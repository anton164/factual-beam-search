    "source": "Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism. Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: \"At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way. \"That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury. \"Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\" Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further. He added: \"CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also. \"The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.\" Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: \"I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here. \"People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe. \"The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.\" Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise \u00c2\u00a360,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \"Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling. \"There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues. \"The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling.\" A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: \"We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis. \"Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them. \"Public security measures such as CCTV are not uncommon practice within other historic sites and buildings and we would work with the applicant to discuss possible options.\"",

The tourist, a certified diver, was helped to the surface but could not be revived. It comes after two French tourists died while snorkelling on the reef at Michaelmas Cay on Wednesday. They are both believed to have suffered cardiac arrests. Paramedics were alerted to the latest tragedy just after 12.30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Friday. \"CPR was performed on a male patient in his sixties by a nurse on board a vessel and subsequently by a doctor,\" a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said. The Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO) said the alarm was raised when the diver was spotted without a regulator in his mouth 15m (49ft) below sea level on the ocean floor. \"We're not sure as to what has happened at this stage,\" a Quicksilver spokeswoman said. The man was travelling with his wife. It was his second dive of the day from a boat called Silver Sonic. AMPTO executive director Col McKenzie said the boat was carrying oxygen and defibrillation equipment and had operated for 11 years without serious incident. \"Accidents like this are a tragedy for the surviving family members, the crew and the passengers,\" he said. Agincourt Reef is about 100km (62 miles) north of the city of Cairns, and about 60km north of Michaelmas Cay.",

    "source": "The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks \"threatened internet safety\". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. \"The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,\" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read \"Do you have a conscience?\".",

Sunni rebels led by militant group Isis have occupied large swathes of northern and western Iraq. They have declared a large region straddling Iraq and Syria a caliphate or Islamic state. About 10,000 Indians are reported to be working in Iraq. Scores of them have returned to India since fighting began. \"We are very happy [to be freed],\" Marina Jose, one of the nurses released by the militants told NDTV. \"We never thought we would come out because the situation was very bad.\" She said that the militants had for the most part treated them well. At the airport: Imran Qureshi, BBC News, Kochi. The nurses received a tumultuous welcome, led by their families and the chief minister of the southern state of Kerala, Oomen Chandy. Every political party was represented. The nurses gave differing accounts of how they had been treated. One nurse, Shermin Varghese, told the BBC the militants in Tikrit had said they were being taken to an airport. Another, Marina Jose, said they had been told only that they were heading to Mosul. They said they had burst into tears when the militants showed them their bombs and ammunition on the bus. But both of them said they had not been mistreated. The exact circumstances of their release are unclear - they are reported to have been pressured into boarding buses and leaving the hospital by jihadist fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis). They were reportedly then taken to Mosul before being freed. The specially-chartered flight was also carrying about 100 other Indians leaving Iraq. Tikrit is among a number of towns and cities seized by jihadist-led Sunni rebels in recent weeks. Some of the nurses told the BBC by phone a few days ago that fighting had reached the hospital compound and there had been several explosions close to where they had been hiding.",

    "source": "However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. \"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. \"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained. \"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. \"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said. \"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. \"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. \"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. \"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. \"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.",

Two more were suspended, while three others were banned for other misconduct involving sexual content. The National Union of Teachers said it was not a common occurrence in schools. David Evans, secretary of National Union of Teachers Cymru, said: \"We have to be mindful when reviewing these figures that this is a very small number of teachers across the whole profession over a period of a few years. This is by no means a common occurrence in our schools.\" He added the union often dealt with malicious and false allegations against teachers, which remained a concern, but said it was right allegations were investigated and any teachers found abusing their positions should face the full consequences. Donald Findlater, of child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said the changing online environment and social networking in recent years had introduced \"massive challenges and risks\". He said some staff got into trouble out of naivety, rather than malice, and schools must ensure adequate training is given so teachers know the boundaries. A spokeswoman for child abuse charity NSPCC Cymru said: \"Schools need to be rigorous in their recruitment and checking processes and provide regular training about appropriate behaviour, making it absolutely clear that crossing the line will never be tolerated.\" During the same period, other teachers were disciplined after being convicted of driving, alcohol, drugs, harassment and fraud offences. Others were punished for assaulting pupils, helping children cheat during tests, failing to achieve required standards, not following health and safety procedures, and failing to investigate bullying.",

    "source": "Alex Gray, from Perth in Tayside, is awaiting sentence after being convicted earlier this month of burglary and harassment. The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed \"the system has failed him\", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a \"nuisance rather than a victim\" by police, adding that the experience had left her \"a changed person\". Gray's mother Michelle said she had tried to get help for her son from the authorities for years. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain programme, she said: \"I had no idea that he had been stalking Lily Allen and putting her through these years of torture. \"We knew he had a fixation with her but not that he had actually been anywhere near her. \"We just thought he had a fantasy in his head.\" What's the difference between a super-fan and a stalker? It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker? Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom. \"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats. READ MORE. She added: \"We knew he had a mental disorder and he had been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia two years ago and he was meant to be on medication for this, but nobody was ensuring that that was happening. \"It escalated after his dad died. He got worse and we knew he was getting worse. We tried to get him help and nobody would help us at all.\" His sister Kaylie Gray said: \"I don't think it's going to be good for either party - for Alex, for us, for her (Allen) - if he just goes to prison because he's not going to get any help. \"He's just going to continue to get worse and then he's going to get released without any help and we are just back to square one again.\" Asked if Gray had shown any remorse, his sister replied: \"No, Alex is a very closed book. \"He doesn't like to talk about anything and because of his disorder he thinks people are tapping phones, so he won't talk to me about things like that over the phone.\" His mother added: \"He finds it hard to... separate what's real and what's not real, it's part of his illness, I think.\" Kaylie Gray said the family has not had any contact with Lily Allen. She added: \"We are really sorry that it got this far. It's horrendous what her and her family have had to go through and obviously we feel so horrible for her.\" In an interview with The Observer, Allen said: \"Until he gets the right treatment and the right help he needs, then I'm not safe. \"You can throw the book at him, put him in jail, but he'll still be coming out. And the victim is never safe.\" A Metropolitan Police spokesman would not comment on Allen's case but said they took stalking and harassment \"extremely seriously\".",

    "source": "Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13. The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of \"bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10%. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available\". South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by \u00a329.3m from \u00a3520m. Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability\". Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding. \"If the government is serious about putting mental health care on an equal footing with physical health, then it's going to need a really serious commitment in the next parliament.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Commissioners are expected to give a real-terms funding increase to mental health this year. \"NHS funding for mental health increased by \u00a3300m last year.\"",

A new \"UK settled status\" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK \"does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up\". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining \"UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, \"I hate Brexit from every angle.\" \"It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. \"I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said. \"I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. \"This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" he said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Toronto police said the stage collapsed at 16:00 local time (20:00). Police said the person who died was a man in his 30s, but did not reveal his identity. The victims were all part of a team involved with setting up the stage, officials said. Alexandra Halbert, who was working in a beer tent at the show, said she was about 200-300 yards away from the stage, with her back to it, when she heard \"something that sounded like fireworks\". \"I turned around and the whole top part of the stage had collapsed, as well as the scaffolding,\" she told the BBC. \"It seemed like there were a couple of minutes of hesitation and no one knew quite what to do. It was only afterwards that we all realised how serious it was.\" Jason Ip, a food vendor, said there was \"chaos\" as people waited for the emergency services to arrive. \"A few people started running towards the stage. No one knew exactly what had happened, but it was clear that people were underneath the stage,\" he said. \"It was like witnessing a car accident. In a situation like that, you just aren't sure how to react.\" Some 40,000 people were expected for the sold-out gig, which was also due to feature Canadian musician Caribou.",

The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70\u2009million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January. Morricone's soundtrack will be released by Decca on 18 December.",

    "source": "Gareth Southgate's side went out in the group stage in the Czech Republic. \"We made the decision and I back it,\" Ashworth told the BBC's senior football reporter Ian Dennis. \"Youth teams are there to help develop players and give them experience to get into the seniors.\" Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, Arsenal midfielders Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere and Manchester United defender Phil Jones were among those eligible but not called up. Media playback is not supported on this device. Ashworth added: \"Those players are established internationals. It's like being a first-team player and asking them to come back and play in the U21s. It's not necessarily the right thing to do. \"The players who hadn't competed in the two-year cycle and lead-up to the European Championship wouldn't be considered. \"The debate will be reopened now but we stand by the decision Gareth and I made. You never know when you drop players into a new group whether it'll be the right thing to do.\" England, who had Premier League quality in Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton defender John Stones and new Liverpool forward Danny Ings, lost 1-0 to Portugal, beat Sweden by the same score but then lost 3-1 to Italy. Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. \"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories. \"In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams. \"They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that. We can't after six months say that's wrong, let's just crash it down the other end as quickly as we can. \"We're starting to see a different kind of player come through the system now. Three years into EPPP [Elite Player Performance Plan] we're seeing players more capable with the ball. I believe it will stand us in good stead in years to come. Is it too soon now to see that? Yes, perhaps.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. FA chairman Greg Dyke set a target in 2013 for England to win the World Cup by 2022 and Ashworth is adamant that this remains a realistic goal. \"Yes I do believe that,\" he said. \"I genuinely believe we have a lot of good young players in the system. We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. \"We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. \"You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments. But that takes time - it doesn't happen overnight. \"We're all doing the right things but we need to sit tight and be a little patient and let it run its course. I'm convinced it will.\" Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker criticised the \"exasperatingly amateurish approach\" not to select players such as Sterling, Wilshere and Barkley for the tournament. \"We never learn. What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience,\" the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation. It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things. \"The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom. The England national team will underperform at every single tournament for this reason. \"The players think 'I'm too good for the under-21s, I've been in a senior squad - I don't want to go to a major tournament. I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'. \"Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it. That's the problem with the Premier League being stronger than the FA. It's impossible for England to build good teams. \"The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. \"I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line.\" Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. \"We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. \"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff. Raheem Sterling doesn't want to play for Liverpool - he certainly would have caused more problems for the under-21s than he would have done them good. \"When me and Joey were coming through, playing for the under-21s and national team was massive kudos. \"That doesn't happen now, they're given so much so early in club football that England Under-21s has become secondary. There isn't the same desire to play for them. Spain and Germany still have the desire to play for their Under-21s - they get paid an awful lot less than our players. \"English players are paid too much and clubs put pressure on them not to go to the tournament - 'We want to save you for next season'. We have to change this culture. \"I can't believe players even consider not playing for the under-21s. Those players like Barkley or Sterling could have called Gareth up and said 'I want to be in your side'.\" You can listen to BBC Radio 5 live's Dan Ashworth interview and the reaction to the England Under-21s' performance from Joey Barton and Danny Mills here.",

Mr Gove said he regretted standing for the Tory leadership, saying he made \"mistakes\" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a Gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron. He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 June poll, he said. Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job. Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way\". \"As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made... \"I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches. \"When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too,\" said Mr Gove. \"So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \"I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr Gove said he is now focusing on his work on the Commons committee on exiting the EU and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

    "source": "Jack Beales, 93, of Rhyl, carried out the attacks while she was a young girl, mainly when he was in his 70s. He denied five charges of rape and six other sexual offences but was unanimously convicted by the jury at Mold Crown Court on 9 December. Sentencing him on Wednesday, Judge Rhys Rowlands said Beales had destroyed his victim's childhood. His victim, now aged in her 30s, took to the witness stand to read her victim impact statement. The court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years. She said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped, when she confronted Beales last summer, it would bring some kind of closure. But she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety, and was awaiting counselling. The court had heard she confronted Beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child. He later said \"that was what men did\". The woman said every time she came into contact with Beales he made hurtful comments. She said: \"Once again I felt suicidal and felt I could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life, with no apparent suffering.\" The woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family. But she added: \"I worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean I am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term.\" She said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world \"as a very dangerous place\". \"I am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men,\" she told the court. \"I feel unable to relax, and as though I have a responsibility to be watchful over others.\" Defending barrister Andrew Green said Beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes. Jailing him, Judge Rowlands said Beales did not have \"an ounce of remorse\" and was \"devoid of any moral compass at all\". He will have to serve a further 12 months on licence. Det Insp William Jones, of North Wales Police, said: \"John (Jack) Beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time. He is now thankfully behind bars. \"No child should ever have to experience what the victim went through.\" An NSPCC Wales spokesman said the victim \"must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so Beales could eventually face justice for his crimes\".",

    "source": "His solicitor Julia Cooper has asked Surrey Police to explain a statement that he had confessed to the murder. Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a \"covert tape\" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said \"my client denies giving a confession\". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police.",

    "source": "They will consider plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale. Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. \"We are extremely ambitious for this new service. \"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a \u00c2\u00a3650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the \u00c2\u00a3600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was \"very much not the goal\" for the BBC to \"take over all local journalism\".",

    "source": "It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market. \"One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (\u00c2\u00a368,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip. Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.",

Chloe Stott, 18, is the daughter of Katy Stott, who was born 2,000ft above Orkney in 1973 on a special air ambulance flight from the island of Stronsay to Kirkwall. The aircraft was only a few minutes into the short flight when Katy's mother Freida Devin gave birth. Chloe said she has always wanted to be a cabin crew attendant. Thick fog prevented the aircraft from landing in Kirkwall, and Captain Jamie Bayley had to divert to Aberdeen.

The plant will create 150 jobs on the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone, which is still hoping to be home to the \u00c2\u00a3325m Circuit of Wales. New owners, who bought the British brand three years ago, will start production next year. The company has a 10-year plan, including four new models, and will begin making a few hundred cars a year. TVR had been looking at three sites around the UK. Mr Jones said: \"This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. \"TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales.\" There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year. TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government. \"South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.\" The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially. It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth \u00c2\u00a33.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement \"sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing\". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was \"surging from strength to strength.\" He added: \"Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.\" Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as \"fantastic\" for the region. \"Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,\" he added.",

Terribly illegally.\" Jones says his side have a stronger scrum, adding if the laws are enforced England \"will get an advantage\". Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. \"He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,\" said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been \"found out\" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. \"There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted,\" said McBryde. \"So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere.\" However, Jones says he is \"quite upset\" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. \"They play the laws very well,\" the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. \"They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. \"And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. \"Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens? The referee gets criticised. \"We really want to have a scrum contest on Saturday - it's an important part of the game - so we are really hopeful the referee enforces the law in that area.\" Jones added: \"If you are the referee and you keep penalising Wales for pre-engaging, then all the smart guys in the commentators' box say 'this referee is ruining the game'. \"But they are not ruining the game, it's the team that is scrummaging illegally which is ruining the game. \"So we want the referee to be really hard, and if he has to ruin the game, he has to ruin the game.\"",

But after \"time to reflect\" on the meeting and feedback from fans, he has now \"withdrawn from any involvement\". He had said: \"I'm not convinced change will happen quickly or thoroughly enough under Fawaz's ownership.\" But following his decision to withdraw his interest, he explained: \"As for fans which questioned my motive, I want the club to be in safe hands, competitive and in the top division. \"My current business, career and health are way more important to me than pushing against a tide of doubt, spite and rabble rousing, so I'll stick to the odd Q&A in Nottingham now and again to say hello to those who supported me back in the day.\" Collymore was involved in a protest against Al Hasawi on 21 January, which followed the collapse of a proposed takeover of the club by a US-based consortium led by John Jay Moores. \"I believe Fawaz will stay in the short/medium term,\" Collymore wrote on his blog. \"Unless JJM [Moores] meet the asking price of \u00a350m or as Fawaz said \"the Chinese offer silly money\", it is my belief that he feels he has the resources, passion and plan to move the club forward.\" Forest are currently 19th in the Championship, just five points above the relegation zone. They sacked manager Philippe Montanier on 14 January, making the Frenchman the seventh to leave the City Ground since the Al Hasawi family took over in July 2012. Meanwhile, the Nottingham Forest Supporters' Trust have been given an assurance by the city council that the land on which the City Ground is built will never be sold. The stadium is owned by the club, but the land still belongs to the council. The Supporters' Trust have also applied to register the City Ground as an Asset of Community Value, meaning they would have first refusal to purchase the stadium if it were ever to be sold, with six months to raise the required funds. \"This is a key safeguarding measure for the future of our football club,\" a spokesperson said. \"With our membership now live and having already seen hundreds of members join up, we have a huge wealth of skills to call upon to continue to push further initiatives forward.\"",

Bayern need a maximum of 11 points from their final five league matches to secure the title for Guardiola before he leaves to join Manchester City at the end of the season. The Bayern boss rotated his squad with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg trip to Benfica in mind, beginning with Thomas Muller, Philipp Lahm, Costa and Thiago on the bench. But he brought on Muller after just 27 minutes, concerned that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal was in danger of getting sent off after making two reckless challenges and collecting an early booking. Stuttgart captain Niedermeier scored at the wrong end as he stretched to prevent Franck Ribery's cross reaching Robert Lewandowski. Austria international Alaba added another early in the second half, showing neat footwork before beating goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton at the near post. Didavi, Stuttgart's leading scorer, improvised superbly to pull a goal back with just under half-an-hour left as he hooked the ball past Manuel Neuer while on the ground for his 11th of the season, but Costa's 25-yard drive ended hopes of a comeback. Augsburg moved out of the bottom three as they came from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Werder Bremen, who dropped into the relegation play-off place.

    "source": "The area, which accounts for 21% of all second-home ownership in England, is to get \u00a319.1m of the \u00a360m annual fund. The money will be distributed to \"community-led\" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing. Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991. The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices. It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years. In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that \u00a360m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on \"community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities\". The Department for Communities and Local Government said the \u00a360m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem. It announced that the South West is set to get \u00a319,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly. The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, \u00a311,336,157. The East of England will get \u00a38.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside \u00a36.4m and the North-West nearly \u00a36m. Friday's breakdown also includes \u00a32.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (\u00a32.7m). West Midlands (\u00a31.9m) and north-east England (\u00a31.3m). In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills.. Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: \"We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.\" Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: \"The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community. \"This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.\" During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas. It \"must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people\" during the second year. But Labour's Mr Healey said: \"Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991. \"After six years of failure on housing, people want to see government ministers get to grips with the country's housing crisis not produce more press releases.\" Councillor Martin Tett, for the Local Government Association,. LGA housing spokesman, said there must be a \"renaissance in house building by councils\" to provide enough affordable homes to rent and buy: \"This means powers and funding [being] given to councils to replace sold homes and reinvest in building more of the genuinely affordable homes our communities desperately need.\"",

Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. \"Some of the comments went too far,\" Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. \"If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to,\" he said. Haye added he now has a \"different kind of respect\" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. \"When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring,\" he said. \"When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way.\" Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing \"irreparable damage\" to his ankle and foot. \"It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap,\" he said. \"I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. \"I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. \"I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short.\" Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch \"solely depends on Tony\" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. \"I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody,\" he said. \"Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. \"Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. \"For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion.\"",

Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events. 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor. In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images. BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch. Full coverage: Queen at 90. Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview. BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell. The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations. Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".",

    "source": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

Among them were members of the governing Workers Party and groups which back President Dilma Rousseff. But the names, published in a magazine, also included rivals of Ms Rousseff. Many of the names were published in Veja, one of Brazil's leading magazines, just weeks before the presidential election in which Ms Rousseff is running for a second term in office. Several politicians mentioned have denied involvement. Mr Costa claimed that politicians received 3% commissions on the values of contracts signed with Petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012. He alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes. Mr Costa was arrested in 2013. He is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names. Ahead of the election, Ms Rousseff's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival, former Environment Minister Marina Silva. The BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro says the latest allegations could hurt the incumbent further, as during her presidency Petrobras has dramatically underperformed and its costs have risen sharply. It has become one of the world's most indebted oil companies and lost half of its market value in three years. The BBC has requested a comment from Petrobras about the latest allegations and is awaiting a response.",

The vigils were held on 13 November in Bristol, London, Cape Town and also Sweden where she was born. South African authorities have applied to have Mr Dewani extradited over claims he was involved in her murder. He denies the charges. Taxi driver Zola Tongo from Bothasig, Cape Town, has been jailed for 18 years for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice after agreeing a plea bargain. Mr Dewani, from Bristol, faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice. Mr Dewani's extradition was backed by Home Secretary Theresa May after a judge approved the move in August. An appeal has been lodged with the High Court. Mrs Dewani's uncle, Manoj Panchmatia, who helped organise the vigils, said it had been \"a very difficult year for the family\". \"We are all looking for some form of closure,\" he added. Mr Panchmatia said the idea had come from users of Facebook who wanted to do \"something special\". He said the family had received hundreds of emails from people saying they planned to light a candle. The vigils, including one in Harrow, north London, where Mrs Dewani lived with relatives before getting married, were scheduled for 17:30 GMT. Two other men, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, are also charged with murder, as well as kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances and will go on trial at the Western Cape High Court next year.

    "source": "Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko told Germany's Bild newspaper: \"The idea of Mercedes is finished. We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device. The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise their veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage. Renault, which supplies only Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso in F1, is in the final stages of negotiations to take over the financially troubled Lotus team, although no deal has yet been completed. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said the Italian company was prepared to supply Red Bull if necessary. He said he was not concerned about their reputation for being able to build highly-competitive chassis in F1, led by their design chief Adrian Newey. Arrivabene said: \"In theory they have big names, with Newey as chief designer and it is easy to think that if you give them the engine they will build a scary chassis, which means they will be really competitive. \"Concerning my team, my engineers and aerodynamicists know their own jobs. For that reason I don't have a problem, and competition is nice when you have a stronger competitor. \"This doesn't mean tomorrow morning we will give our engines to Red Bull or Toro Rosso. \"But I don't see any kind of problem to give our engine to any other team or be scared of the competition before they start. \"This is not the right spirit of competition or what Ferrari represents. We fight with everybody.\"",

    "source": "Derek Bruder was giving evidence as the inquests focused on the final movements of 15-year-old Kevin Williams. He said he made his first statement shortly after the 1989 disaster and was visited by police the following year. While the meeting left him \"confused\", he agreed to make changes. The officer concerned, former Insp Matthew Sawers, denied asking Mr Bruder to change the sense of his statement. Mr Bruder told the inquests into the 96 deaths at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 that he was visited by an inspector from West Midlands Police, who were supplying evidence to the first inquests. He said Insp Sawers spent six hours with him. When the officer went to the bathroom, Mr Bruder said he looked through some of his notes. He said he found a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two, with handwritten notes on it. On one side it said \"first statement\" and on the other side it said \"change to\", Mr Bruder said. During the meeting he said he was asked to speak over the phone to a pathologist from the coroner's office. Mr Bruder, who was 22 at the time of the disaster, said he conceded \"to the doctor's medical superiority\" when it was suggested Kevin could not have been alive when Mr Bruder tried to revive him. He agreed to make changes to his original statement. Among them he accepted he may have been mistaken to say he had felt \"a faint pulse\" while trying to save Kevin. Mr Bruder told the jury he was 100% confident he had felt a pulse and had seen the teenager move while lying on the pitch. The court heard he wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2012 to say West Midlands Police had made a \"deliberate attempt\" to make him change his statement. He told the inquests he stood by that view and the inspector who visited him had not been honest with him. Earlier Mr Bruder told the inquests that, along with a St John Ambulance volunteer medic who gave heart massage, he had tried to resuscitate Kevin. He said he was \"absolutely 100% confident\" he felt a pulse in the teenager's neck, adding: \"It was not something that would appear to me to be absolutely healthy, beating vibrantly, but there was definitely a pulse.\" Asked whether he saw any signs of life while giving CPR, Mr Bruder said: \"Well, to me he was alive. There was a faint pulse.\" The jury also heard from two Liverpool fans who tried to help Kevin while Mr Bruder was with him. One of them, Stephen Rankin, said Kevin did not show any signs of life. Mr Bruder said a female St John Ambulance medic eventually joined the group, and took over the CPR. After trying to resuscitate him she said Kevin had died. Mr Sawers, who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police, told the inquests he had been asked by the original coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to visit Mr Bruder to get further explanation and detail around evidence, including the convulsions and pulse. He was to give a summary of the further statement to the inquests the following day, but denied he had applied pressure on Mr Bruder or had attended with the intention of changing his statement. Mr Sawers said: \"I did not cause him to change the sense of the statement. What I did was to go through the details and to elicit more detail and explanation. \"Everything that I did in my encounter with PC Bruder was done with integrity and with the best of intentions. It wasn't something that I had any personal stake in.\" But Pete Weatherby, representing Kevin's family, suggested there had been \"a determined effort\" to change his statement which was \"inconvenient to the investigation\". Mr Weatherby said that \"it was very inconvenient that here was a serving police officer giving evidence of vital signs in a casualty that died\". He suggested that as a result of the meeting, Mr Sawers came away with a second statement that \"loosened up\" evidence about Kevin's vital signs.

A jury is currently hearing the new inquests in Warrington before coroner Lord Justice Goldring. Mrs Aspinall said: \"It's not just about Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall, it's about everybody involved in this.

Five Saudis, reportedly including a prince, were detained at Beirut's airport after two tonnes of pills branded as Captagon were found in cases due to be loaded onto a private jet. It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. However, it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because of it was too addictive. In 2013, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said 64% of global seizures of amphetamine took place in the Middle East, and that most of the amphetamine was in the form of Captagon pills.",

Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: \"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.\"",

Sergei Glazyev said the US was spending $20m (\u00c2\u00a312.3m; 14.8m euros) a week on Ukrainian opposition groups, supplying \"rebels\" with arms among other things. Accusing the US of ignoring the Memorandum on Security Assurances, he suggested Moscow could also intervene. The American embassy in Kiev declined to comment on his accusations. 21 November 2013: Ukraine announces it will not sign a deal aimed at strengthening ties with the EU, sparking protests. 17 December: Russia agrees to buy $15bn of Ukrainian government bonds and slash the price of gas it sells to the country. 16 January 2014: Parliament passes law restricting the right to protest. 22 January: Two protesters die from bullet wounds during clashes with police in Kiev; protests spread across many cities. 25 January: President Yanukovych offers senior jobs to the opposition, including that of prime minister, but these are rejected. 28 January: Parliament votes to annul protest law and President Yanukovych accepts resignation of PM and cabinet. 29 January: Parliament passes amnesty law for detained protesters, under the condition occupied buildings are vacated. Ukraine's protest leaders. Q&A: Stand-off in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is due to meet Mr Putin on Friday in Sochi, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games there. He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition. Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive. The two speakers also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders in the conversation. The US embassy declined to comment on the tape. Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday. They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully. In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House. He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed. Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: \"According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.\" The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR. Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant. He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force. \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],\" he said. \"Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\" Accusing the Americans of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine\", he said: \"There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.\" Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would \"normalise\" if the US desisted from intervening. Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states. The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment. It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition. At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured. The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists. One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days. \"I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,\" said Mr Bulatov, 35. \"At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.\"",

Last June, Sylvester went on a three-week sheep-killing spree, wandering 300km (180 miles) before he was found taking a nap by rangers and airlifted from the Nuweveld Mountains. When he was found he was fitted with a tracking collar. The second time he escaped, rescuers followed the signal from his collar to find him high up in the mountains in Western Cape again. He was tranquilised and airlifted by helicopter, an operation the park authorities captured on video. He had been away for four days.",

Innogy Renewables UK said the decision to withdraw the application was made following a late request for additional information. It said that Natural Resources Wales' river basin management plan for western Wales had been updated last December, including a change to the sensitivity of salmon fisheries, following which further information had been requested. The project, providing power to 3,200 households, attracted opposition from environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and businesses. The firm has previously said it would have had a positive impact on the environment but campaigners were worried half an acre of the centuries-old Fairy Glen Wood would be destroyed by the build. In March, the park's authority turned the plans down, asking for clarification on \"minor issues\". Innogy Renewables UK Ltd said it would now consider its next steps. Conservation charity the Snowdonia Society said it was \"relieved that the immediate threat to the wonderful Conwy Falls and Fairy Glen has passed, but concerned that it could resurface yet again\".",

The 12ft-high (3.6m) statue features about 40,000 spoons and has taken almost five months to build at the British Ironworks Centre in Oswestry. The spoons have been donated from across the world, as well as local schoolchildren. It is due to be transported to Mr Geller's home in Berkshire on 28 May. It was hoped the statue could be transported to Berkshire by helicopter, but after safety fears, the Ironworks Centre said the TV production company behind Shipping Wars had stepped forward to help. By Bethan BellBBC News. About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as \"an amazing piece of art\". He said: \"This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.\" \"I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" he added. \"It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. \"Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000,\" he said. \"It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals.\" He said the project had given him \"sleepless nights\" and now \"just the word 'spoon' is enough to drive me crazy\". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as \"a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about \u00c2\u00a3120,000 in staff time, but described it as an \"exciting rollercoaster of a ride\". He said the experience had given the firm \"an immense appetite to do something even better\" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would \"celebrate Britain\".",

From prison he told his now estranged wife Giulia Masciopinto, 37, to unearth cash buried in their Bedford garden. She has been jailed for nine months. Her mother Caterina De Filippo, 58, and sister Palma De Filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico Masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term. His wife also pleaded guilty to the charge, but the De Filippos, who she enlisted but who denied the accusations, were found guilty last month. Judge Kristina Montgomery QC, sitting at Amersham Law Courts for Aylesbury Crown Court, said the Masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the Bedford homes of Giulia Masciopinto, in Redhall Close, and her mother's in Harrowden Road, in March 2013. Officers were alerted by Masciopinto's recorded prison calls to his wife, as he feared the buried cash would perish as it was not in watertight containers. A holdall containing \u00a3237,000 was discovered, while thousands of pounds were also found in a handbag, plastic bag and foil-wrapped bundles. Other money had been paid into bank accounts. Palma De Filippo, of High St, Acton, west London, helped by hiding some of the cash in her car boot and laundering it. Det Insp Pushpa Guild, of Bedfordshire Police, called it a \"sophisticated attempt\" to hide criminal proceeds. Police said some seized cash would go towards paying a \u00a3121,736 confiscation order, made after Masciopinto was jailed three years ago.

But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device. Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays. But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half. Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. \"The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. \"From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins. \"I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home. \"That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really.

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.",

    "source": "Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent \"excessive\" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. \"Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,\" she said. \"Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.\" Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:. The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. \"It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,\" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. \"I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,\" he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the \u00c2\u00a35,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. \"I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,\" he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. \"It can be a daily nightmare,\" he said. \"I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.\" Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his \"14th winter\" on the bicycle is worth it to save \"several thousands of pounds a year\" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. \"I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,\" he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. \"But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,\" he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be \"excessive\", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. \"Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London,\" he said.",

    "source": "The Premier League hosts huffed and puffed before Divock Origi stole behind the Leeds defence to sweep in Trent Alexander-Arnold's right-wing cross from close range. They secured a place in the last four when Wales Under-19 international Woodburn, aged 17 years and 45 days, fired in the second to beat Owen's record by 98 days. Liverpool hit a post through Georginio Wijnaldum shortly before the opener, but the scoreline was somewhat harsh on the Yorkshire side. Leeds winger Kemar Roofe curled against the inside of a post shortly after half-time. Hadi Sacko spurned a good opportunity for the visitors in the opening 10 minutes, and Kyle Bartley nodded a free header wide after the break. Liverpool will find out who they play in the semi-finals when the draw is made after Wednesday's matches. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp might have claimed his team has \"unfinished business\" in the EFL Cup, but this competition is clearly not the German's priority this season as the Reds chase the Premier League title and a Champions League return. And that has been clear by his team selections. Klopp, like he did in the earlier rounds, rotated his team by bringing in fringe players and a handful of youngsters, though that was forced in part by the absence of Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana through injury. Without that attacking threat, the home side lacked fluency and potency in the final third until they clicked in the final 15 minutes to reach a record 17th League Cup semi-final. However, a laboured night was capped when Woodburn - on as a second-half substitute having made his debut on Saturday against Sunderland - beat Owen's record by 98 days. It was a special moment for the youngster in front of the Kop and former England striker Owen, who was watching from the main stand. Every one of Woodburn's outfield team-mates came to celebrate the historic moment as Anfield saluted their latest star. Matches between these two clubs may be rare in the modern era - but this is a fixture steeped in history. A rivalry born in the days of Bill Shankly and Don Revie, resurrected in the eras of Kenny Dalglish and Howard Wilkinson, consigned to longer memories post-Gerard Houllier and David O'Leary. And it attracted the imagination of both sets of fans, Leeds bringing almost 5,500 to a capacity crowd of 53,000. While this tie did not have the allure of a title-swinging league match or Wembley cup final of previous eras, it did provide an opportunity for Leeds to test themselves again at the highest level. Following a turbulent few seasons under Italian owner Massimo Cellino, there is a cautious optimism among Whites fans that their club may - finally - push for promotion back to the Premier League this season. Manager Garry Monk has provided a calm guidance rarely seen - or allowed - under Cellino's control, moving the club up to fifth in the Championship after four wins in their past five matches. The odds were stacked heavily in favour of the home side prior to kick-off, but the visitors created several decent opportunities against a casual Reds defence. Ultimately, they lost with a fight. But the reception given by the away fans to their players at the final whistle suggests they are optimistic a 13-year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future. Leeds United manager Garry Monk:. \"I asked them to play in slightly different way to what we have been doing tactically, which we had to do against a very good side. \"We followed it to a tee. It just lacked us taking one of quite a few opportunities. We had the best chances of the game. \"It needed a bit more composure, that's the only negative. Better decision-making in the final third and we would have had a couple of goals. Overall I was gutted for the players. \"As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. We're growing. We are disappointed but they will look back in time and think we have put on a good performance. \"I'm not going to criticise my team - they were excellent.\" Back to a Premier League title push for Liverpool. The Reds, who are a point behind leaders Chelsea, travel to 12th-placed Bournemouth on Sunday at 13:30 GMT.

    "source": "While its recommended nationwide pay rate goes up from \u00a37.85 an hour to \u00a38.25 - an increase of 40p - in London the suggested rise is only 25p. Next year, when the government brings in a compulsory National Living Wage across the United Kingdom, there will be no separate rate for London. The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living. The capital's voluntary living wage - which is not legally enforceable - is assessed by the Living Wage Foundation and economists at the Greater London Authority. Mayor Boris Johnson's office estimates 724 employers in London have now signed up. Those employers now have six months to implement the new pay level. National minimum wage: The current mandatory minimum is \u00a36.70 per hour for people aged 21 and over, and \u00a35.30 for those aged 18 to 20. National Living Wage: This will be mandatory from April 2016 for workers aged 25 and above. It will initially be set at \u00a37.20 an hour and is intended to exceed \u00a39 an hour by 2020. London living wage: A voluntary higher rate of the living wage in the capital, which will rise from \u00a39.15 to \u00a39.40 an hour. There are currently no plans to make this scheme mandatory. Mr Johnson said the move would help \"pay the people who work hardest on lowest incomes decently\". While he is a prominent supporter of the voluntary London living wage, he has resisted calls to make it mandatory, saying small businesses \"would struggle with wage rigidity\". Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan called in-work poverty \"a shameful blight on our city\", adding: \"Neither the government nor the mayor are doing enough to turn things round.\" The Green Party highlighted disparity between the new recommended rate in London and the national minimum wage for Londoners aged 18 to 20, currently \u00a35.30 an hour. Assembly Member Baroness Jones said: \"The mayor should be making the case for raising the minimum wage in London to a living wage, especially for young Londoners.\"",

    "source": "\"This film will help bridge the gap between people of the Indian mainland and those from the north-eastern states,\" Mary Kom told the BBC. The five-time world champion is from the remote northeast state of Manipur. Bhansali, who has been planning the film for a year, described the boxer as an \"inspiration to every Indian woman\". \"I am very impressed with the way Mary Kom is leading her life with so much conviction and courage. We'll start working on the film very soon. I haven't decided on who will play her role,\" Bhansali told the BBC. Recently, thousands of north-eastern people fled the Indian cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad fearing reprisal attacks in the wake of ethnic clashes between Bodo tribes and Muslims in the north-eastern state of Assam. The boxer says she has been worried about her relatives and friends living in Bangalore and \"could not properly sleep at night when this exodus was taking place\". The mother of twin boys feels that Bhansali's film on her will help clear the air because \"our people look different but they are Indians. We have the same passions when the country is involved\". Bhansali's assistant Omung Kumar, who researched Mary Kom's life and wrote the script, will direct the film. But will it be possible to screen the movie in the boxer's home state Manipur, where separatist rebels have imposed a ban on Bollywood films? \"I hope nobody will object to a film if it centres on my life story, my struggles to become a boxer,\" Mary Kom said. India's thriving film industry has rarely picked on themes from the country's long-embattled north-eastern states and the few films that have been made have focused on the separatist insurgencies and India's counter-insurgency efforts in the region.",

Ms Davies said Wales was not near where it should be on renewables, particularly when compared to Scotland's \"strong leadership position\". \"We didn't create that environment initially and we're paying the price for it now,\" she told the Wales at Work programme. \"Unfortunately there isn't a huge amount we can do about that now because the [UK] government sets the level of support that is provided,\" she said. A Welsh government spokesman said it did not have the same energy powers as Scotland, and defended its green energy record. The UK government said its priority was to move towards a low-carbon economy and ensure subsidies were used where they were needed most.",

    "source": "The legend of Emperor Yu states that he tamed the flooded Yellow River by dredging and redirecting its channels, thereby laying the foundations for the Xia dynasty and Chinese civilisation. Previously, no scientific evidence had been found for a corresponding flood. But now a Chinese-led team has placed just such an event at about 1,900BC. Writing in Science Magazine, the researchers describe a cataclysmic event in which a huge dam, dumped across the Jishi Gorge by a landslide, blocked the Yellow River for six to nine months. When the dam burst, up to 16 cubic kilometres of water inundated the lowlands downstream. The evidence for this sequence of events comes from sediments left by the dammed lake, high up the sides of Jishi Gorge, as well as deposits left kilometres downstream by the subsequent flood. Lead author Dr Wu Qinglong, from Nanjing Normal University, said he and colleagues stumbled on sediments from the ancient dam during fieldwork in 2007. \"It inspired us to connect the next possible outburst flood with the abandonment of the prehistoric Lajia site 25km downstream,\" he told journalists in a teleconference. \"But at that time we had no idea what the evidence of a catastrophic outburst flood should be.\" The Lajia site, famously home to the world's oldest noodles, is known as China's Pompeii; its cave dwellings and many cultural artefacts were buried by a major earthquake. \"In July 2008 I suddenly realised that the so-called black sand previously revealed by archaeologists at the Lajia site could be, in fact, the deposits from our outburst flood,\" Dr Wu said. \"The subsequent investigation confirmed this speculation and showed that the sediments from this outburst flood are up to 20m thick, and up to 50m higher than the Yellow River - indicating an unprecedented, devastating flood.\" He and his colleagues suggest in their paper that the very same earthquake that destroyed the Lajia dwellings probably dammed the river upstream. Less than a year later, the waters returned with a vengeance. \"The flood was about 300-500,000 cubic metres per second,\" said co-author Dr Darryl Granger, from Purdue University in the US. \"That's roughly equivalent to the largest flood ever measured on the Amazon river; it's among the largest known floods to have happened on Earth during the past 10,000 years.\" Using carbon dating - on flood deposits and even on fragments of bone from earthquake victims at Lajia - the researchers date the megaflood to 1,922BC, \"plus or minus about 28 years\", Dr Granger said. If the flood was indeed the source of the Emperor Yu legend then the founding of the Xia dynasty presumably occurred within a few decades, in about 1,900BC. This date is 200-300 years later than many previous estimations. But Emperor Yu's tale is difficult to pin down using traditional historical sources; the story survived as oral history for a millennium and its first known written record dates to around 1,000BC. On the other hand a later, circa 1,900 commencement for the Xia supports that idea that this first dynasty coincided with the transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age ways of living. Some archaeologists have already linked the Xia dynasty with the Erlitou culture, an early Bronze Age society known from digs elsewhere in the Yellow River valley. Dr David Cohen from National Taiwan University, another co-author, said the study was remarkable because of the multiple lines of evidence involved. \"We have the geological evidence of just a huge outburst flood, which is incredible in itself,\" he said. \"But then there's this coincidence of it co-occurring with the destruction of the Lajia site - which is able to give us very, very precise dates\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and then that this flood was of such a scale and corresponds in time, and along the Yellow River, with both the beginnings of Bronze Age civilisation and the legend of the great flood itself. \"It's just this amazing story. All these different approaches coming together - it is just great luck.\" Prof David Montgomery of the University of Washington is a geomorphologist with an interest in what rocks can tell us about ancient myths and legends. He was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary for the journal and discussed the findings on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action. Among the world's various flood myths, Prof Montgomery said, Emperor Yu's story is an odd one. \"It's not about surviving. His basic story is about draining the flood waters; it's about river engineering.\" The case made for the Jishi Gorge megaflood is a plausible one, he said, particularly because it describes a flood that would have broken the Yellow River's banks far downstream and re-routed its flow. Prof Montgomery said this is just the sort of event that would take decades to deal with - and a long battle with the waters is a feature of the Yu myth. \"It's very difficult to ever actually prove the origin of pre-written history events. But they've made a very interesting case, that I'm sure geologists will continue to poke at, and investigate, and argue about - because that's what we do.\" At a purely geological level, he added, the flood is a major and intriguing discovery. \"But the cultural connection - possibly explaining the origin of the Chinese flood story - is too intriguing to ignore.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.",

The world number two inspired Great Britain to win the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years with victory over Belgium in Ghent over the weekend. Captain Leon Smith urged the LTA to use that triumph to inspire future players, but Murray, 28, said he \"did not know where the next generation are\". \"Nothing ever gets done and I don't like wasting my time,\" he said. The Scot added he has not discussed the lack of young British players competing in Grand Slams with LTA chief executive Michael Downey. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"I don't speak to any of the people who are in a high-up position about that,\" Murray revealed. \"I haven't really spoken to them about anything. \"It's concerning not to have any juniors in the Grand Slams because that is something we were always very good at. It's not ideal.\" Downey earlier said Britain's Davis Cup win was a \"special, emotional moment\" that could drive interest in the sport. Before the final in Ghent, Murray was criticised by former Great Britain Davis Cup captain David Lloyd for not putting enough back into the game. \"I'd rather concentrate on my own stuff and when I've finished playing, I'll have a lot more time to try and help or give back to the game,\" Murray added. \"Just now, I've just got to concentrate on trying to win as much as possible.\" Murray said one of his main frustrations was a lack of players to practise with whenever he is in the UK. After returning from the Shanghai Masters in October, Murray said he arrived at the National Training Centre in London to find no other players present. \"I was there on a Monday at about 3pm and then on Tuesday, at the same time,\" he said. \"There was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym. I took photos of it because the place cost like \u00a340m and there are no people.\" Prior to Murray's comments, Smith said the LTA needed to quickly create a long-term strategy to capitalise on his team's victory. Smith also praised Judy Murray's tennis programmes but said the mother of British number one Andy and doubles specialist Jamie \"needs a lot of help\". \"She can't keep doing it on her own,\" he added. Media playback is not supported on this device. Murray leads the LTA's Miss-Hits programme - an introductory course for girls aged between five and eight - and a Scottish-based scheme, Tennis on the Road. Smith, who became Davis Cup captain five years ago with the team a play-off away from relegation to the event's lowest tier, added: \"At the end of the day, we all care about British tennis a lot. \"What we want to see is more people playing, so there should be a bigger talent pool in years to come. \"It really is an important time to get strategies rolled out as quickly as possible, not only to get people on the court but to keep them on the court.  We need to offer them good clubs and good coaches that turn up in all weather and bang out great sessions. Let's hope it has a positive influence, because it should do.\" The LTA was criticised for failing to capitalise on Murray's Wimbledon victory in 2013 with participation levels falling in the aftermath. But LTA chief Downey said the coverage created by Britain's successful weekend in Belgium should help \"encourage participation\". In the most recent figures released by Sport England, for the six months up to March 2015, tennis participation was up.",

    "source": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. \"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's \u00c2\u00a35 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than \u00c2\u00a34 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

    "source": "Police say they broke up the crowd of about 150 in the suburb of Ferguson after being called to the scene of a disturbance after the curfew started. A police car reportedly came under fire and a person was hurt in an apparently unrelated shooting in the same area. Black teenager Michael Brown was shot by a white policeman on 9 August. The shooting of the 18-year-old as he walked down a street drew allegations of police brutality among people in the mainly black suburb of Ferguson. A riot erupted on Friday night, with local stores targeted by looters, after police named the officer who shot Mr Brown and also released CCTV from a shop where he apparently stole a pack of cigars and intimidated the owner just before his death. A five-hour curfew, running from midnight (05:00 GMT), was imposed in response. US civil rights leader Al Sharpton has said a peaceful rally, led by Michael Brown's family, is planned for later on Sunday. The teenager's killing caused dismay across the US, with peaceful nationwide vigils held on Thursday night, while images of riot police deployed in an American city suburb have made headlines worldwide. Seven arrests were made when police moved to break up the protest at a barbecue restaurant. Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of bringing calm back to Ferguson, said police had moved in after receiving a report of people breaking into the restaurant and climbing on to the roof. As police were nearing the restaurant, a man with a handgun went into the street but ran away, AP news agency reports. Someone also shot at a police car but it was not clear if it had been hit. In the same area, a person was shot and critically wounded and police were searching for the attacker. Demonstrators complained that the curfew would make matters worse. As police prepared to move on the protesters during the night, a chant of \"No justice! No curfew!\" could be heard from the crowd, followed by \"We have the right to assemble peacefully\". Jayson Ross, who was leading the protesters toward the police before tear gas was fired, was quoted as saying by AP: \"They got guns. We got guns. We are ready.\" Local politician Antonio French, who was with the protesters, tweeted to say: \"Too many young men talking about they're ready to die tonight.\" Governor Jay Nixon said he would not allow a handful of looters to endanger the community. \"This is a test,\" he said. \"The eyes of the world are watching. We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.\" The US justice department is investigating the shooting of Mr Brown, with 40 FBI agents dispatched to Ferguson to gather information. Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson revealed on Friday that the officer who shot Mr Brown was Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him. Mr Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Commenting on the CCTV footage that was released, Chief Jackson said that Mr Wilson had not known Mr Brown was a robbery suspect. The policeman had reportedly stopped the teenager for walking in the street, disrupting traffic. Mr Brown's family condemned the release of the footage as a police attempt to \"justify the execution-style murder\".",

For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. \"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male\u2014the patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. \"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public\u2026and they did.'\" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. \"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. \"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (\u00a327,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. \"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\" \"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. \"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. \"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. \"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. \"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history. \"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage.\" Follow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv.",

Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel\". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer. Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author. And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom. Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth. This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness. The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women. That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.",

In a unusual move, the warning was published on Friday evening in Israel, after the start of the Jewish Sabbath when government offices close for business. The Counter-Terrorism Bureau urged Israeli families to contact their relatives in India and tell them of the threat. It did not say what had prompted the warning. 'Threats' made to Sydney's New Year's Eve. In 2012, the wife of Israeli diplomat stationed in India was critically wounded in a car bomb attack along with her driver and two others. The incident sparked diplomatic tensions when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of being behind it - a charge strongly denied by Tehran. Israel's warning came hours after Australian anti-terror police charged a man for making threats against Sydney's New Year's Eve celebrations. The 40-year-old was arrested at Sydney Airport on Thursday after arriving on a plane from London. A week ago, Australian police said they had foiled a major terror attack planned for Melbourne on Christmas Day.

Last year's major release was animation Despicable Me 2, which went on to take $368m (\u00a3214m), making it the fourth-biggest movie of the year in the US. But this year, there was no major release to coincide with the holiday. Michael Bay's Transformers, the fourth in the series, has a cast led by Mark Wahlberg. It has received generally poor reviews from critics, as has Tammy. The only other major new release was the horror film Deliver Us From Evil, starring Eric Bana. It opened in third place with $9.5m (\u00a36.9m). The box office will be hoping for a boost next weekend with the release of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, starring Andy Serkis and Gary Oldman. It is expected to be one of the summer's big hitters.",

    "source": "The fratricide within the Republican Party is getting much of the national attention, but the two remaining Democratic candidates - and their supporters - are starting to swing some sharp elbows. The Wisconsin primary on Tuesday marks the beginning of the Democratic presidential campaign's endgame. More than half the pledged delegates have already been apportioned, and only a few truly landscape-altering battlegrounds - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California - remain on the calendar. Mr Sanders can claim momentum, with wins in five of the last six contests, but he needs a sizeable victory in Wisconsin if he wants to properly set the stage for the critical coming contests and cut into Mrs Clinton's 263 delegate lead. It's enough to set both candidates on edge. On Thursday, when confronted by a Greenpeace activist in New York about whether she could address climate change while taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mrs Clinton showed a rare flash of anger. \"I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me,\" she said. Her campaign would later assert that the former secretary of state, like Mr Sanders, takes donations from individuals employed in the energy sector but is prohibited from accepting money from corporations. It was a moment of emotion for a usually carefully controlled candidate - and the Sanders camp quickly responded. \"If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine,\" Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"But to call us liars for pointing out basic facts about the secretary's fundraising is deeply cynical and very disappointing.\" It was just one of numerous recent shots between the two campaigns. When Mrs Clinton unveiled manufacturing proposals on Friday, a Sanders spokesperson said the former secretary of state has embraced \"policies that have decimated the manufacturing industry ... and eliminated millions of jobs across the country\". Trump's disastrous women voter problem - This voting bloc could doom in chances in the general election. #BernieMadeMeWhite: Minority supporters of Sanders speak out - Supporters push back against \"all-white\" narrative. Trump, Clinton and the 'None of the Above' era - Rarely have those running for high office been held in such low esteem. Full US election coverage from the BBC. At a campaign event, Mr Sanders offered criticisms of Mrs Clinton's six-figure speeches to Wall Street firms, her foreign policy views and her position on environmental issues, as his supporters heartily booed. On Saturday Mrs Clinton noted that she has been a \"proud Democrat my adult life\" - drawing a contrast with Mr Sanders, who is a self identified \"democratic socialist\" who serves in Congress as an independent. \"I think that is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Mrs Clinton said. \"I think the secretary is getting very nervous,\" Mr Sanders countered on Sunday, noting that polls show him doing better than Mrs Clinton against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \"I think we've got a lot of young people's vote, working-class people's vote,\" Mr Sanders said. \"I think we're on the way to a victory if we can win the Democratic nomination.\" This tension in the Democrat race is a relatively recent development. Last autumn, Mr Sanders famously said during the first debate that he was \"sick and tired\" of talking about Mrs Clinton's email server imbroglio - passing on a chance to target what could have been a key weakness in his main opponent. When Mr Sanders entered the race, he said he wasn't interested in running a negative political campaign. It was a strategic decision that has led to some recent second-guessing among advisers within the candidate's campaign, as witnessed by a surprisingly pessimistic story in the New York Times on Monday. \"The central complication with Bernie is that he never wanted to cross into the zone of personal attacks because it would undercut his brand,\" Sanders adviser Tad Devine told the Times. That hasn't stopped acrimony from flaring among the two candidates' supporters, however - even in typically restrained states like Wisconsin. Lisa Stubek, a state representative who endorsed Mrs Clinton early in the campaign, says she's caught fire from pro-Sanders constituents in the ultra-liberal state capital of Madison. \"Bernie Sanders supporters are pretty relentless, unfortunately, as far as their support and as far as attacking those who support anyone but their candidate,\" she said. \"And that's not true of everyone, but certainly there is a core group of Bernie Sanders supporters here in Madison who do that.\" While Ms Stubek says that the campaign has largely been above-the-board, things have taken a turn for the worse. \"I think certainly when you have Bernie Sanders out there stretching the truth or out-and-out lying, things do heat up,\" she said. \"I'm glad that Hillary is out there defending her record. More than anything people in our state want the facts.\" Another Madison-area Democratic representative, Melissa Sargent, says she decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in part because the noise between the two candidates would drown out her efforts to address other issues and local campaigns. \"When I go to doors and I'm stumping for my local candidates, I can talk about the things that I want to talk about and I can hear authentically what folks are saying,\" she said. \"It felt like I wouldn't be able to navigate the path that I am with these other races.\" Democrats in Wisconsin are quick to note that their challenges are nothing compared to what the Republicans are facing, as their two leading candidates engage in harsh negative attacks and exchange barbs over their wives and marital infidelity. Brett Hulsey, a former Wisconsin Democratic state representative who is backing Mr Sanders, called the Republican campaign a \"food fight circus\". \"Democrats are still fighting by the Queensberry Rules,\" he said, drawing a boxing analogy. He cautions that while tempers seem to be flaring among Democrats at this point, things will eventually calm down. If Mrs Clinton wins, he plans to support her - and he predicts most Sanders backers will follow suit. \"We're in the middle of the fray right now,\" he said. \"I remind everybody to take a few deep breaths and remain calm. I've worked every presidential since 1980 for Jimmy Carter. I've seen this movie before.\" At a rally in Madison on Sunday night it seemed an era of good feelings may have returned. Mr Sanders spoke to a crowd of 4,200 for more than an hour and made no mention of his Democratic opponent. Instead, he focused his criticism on Mr Trump and Republican Governor (and former candidate) Scott Walker. He also seemed to be broadening his perspective. \"This campaign is about more than just electing a president of the United States, although I would very much appreciate your support,\" he said. \"It's about creating a political revolution.\" After the event, Jess A Weber - who had travelled to Madison from Illinois to volunteer for the Sanders campaign - said she appreciated that Mr Sanders has tried to run a positive campaign. \"He continues to pull focus back to the message and back to our strength in unifying, coming together instead of dividing and bringing anyone down,\" she said. On the campaign trail in Janesville on Monday, however, Mr Sanders was back to swiping at his opponent for her past positions on international trade and commerce. \"I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Mr Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one.\" The Democratic race is far from a bare-knuckle fight, but the candidates aren't done trying to draw blood.",

The new pay deal with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) means an England international will earn up to \u00a3300,000 each year in match fees alone. Along with their club salaries, bonuses and commercial income, an elite player could soon top seven figures per year. \"The market place dictates what they deserve,\" Rugby Players' Association chief executive Hopley told BBC Sport. \"If players are successful and conduct themselves in a way that is becoming to that role model status, then I think they do deserve it.\" The latest RFU accounts showed record profits following the 2015 Rugby World Cup. \"The players generate huge amounts of money for the game,\" Hopley added. \"In the context of the revenues being generated through English rugby, it's a very reasonable deal. \"We wanted to ensure that the players felt they were participating in the commercial upside of the RFU - and despite a disappointing World Cup for everyone, we have seen a fantastic year around English rugby revenues. \"England players in 2003 won \u00a370,000 each for winning the World Cup, while players in this Old Mutual Wealth Series will pick up more than that for playing in four games for England.\" Mark Lambert, the vice-chairman of the RPA, denies that the new deal will lead to a disconnect between elite England players and the rest. \"The way you earn respect as a rugby player is the way you carry yourself, the way you behave, and the example you set for other people,\" the Harlequins prop told BBC Sport. \"All the [Harlequins] guys that have come through the system and gone on to represent England internationally, they are model professionals and deserve what they have achieved in the game. \"We would all like to be earning that money, but it's something that's directly linked to the revenues of the RFU,\" added Lambert, who has made more than 200 top-flight appearances for Quins. \"The RFU make a lot of money and it's only right the England players get that. There is potential for players to make a good amount of money, but you have to put in that hard work first in order to get there.\" The RPA last week held its quarterly board meeting with a variety of issues on the agenda, from artificial pitches to the new rugby calendar. Hopley says the players' union would fully support the notion of a fallow summer in the calendar post-2019, as revealed by the BBC in September, adding: \"The players' voice is on the rise, and rightly so.\" Lambert said: \"It is more important than ever that the players have a strong voice. \"The game is expanding, there is a lot of money and there is lot of opportunity - and we need to make sure the player doesn't get pulled in too many directions. \"It's an exciting time, but we have got to make sure the game stays the same at its core.\"",

Hard luck, Jose.\" Allardyce also praised his team's defensive performance, with his team having conceded 17 goals in their previous five fixtures going into Wednesday's match. \"Tactically we got it right in two areas particularly: one was in stopping [Eden] Hazard, Oscar and Willian and [Samuel] Eto'o scoring goals; and the other one was stopping them scoring from set plays. We did a fantastic job.\"",

I can see it. I believe it.\" He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: \"I speak to him. I know he can hear me. \"His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up. \"His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules.\" Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules. \"I've never seen anything like that,\" Philippe said. \"It touched us very deeply.

Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable. \"One day he seems a bit better, other days a bit worse. The doctors don't say. The damage from the accident is very bad but we don't know how it will evolve. \"Even with Schumacher it took months to come out of the coma.

The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada. The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country. Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity, with black Canadians the most common target. Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion. Canada's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group, accounting for 13% of all incidents, despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes. Shimon Koffler Fogel, with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the data \"disturbing and clear\". He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms. \"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,\" he said. Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015, with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014, accounting for 12% of all incidents. However, Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) to encourage reporting. Incidents targeting Catholics also increased, jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents. Almost 40% of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents, which could include assault and uttering threats. Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence. In a news conference following the report's release, the NCCM's legal counsel, Khalid Elgazzar, pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as \"a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities\". The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting. The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada. They suggest that only about 35% of hate crimes are actually reported to police.",

It is hoped the RNLI camera will reduce the number of launches at Porthcawl, in Bridgend county, which had the second highest number for Wales in 2015. The camera looks out towards the town's pier from the lifeboat station. The location is also notorious for crashing waves that can risk sweeping people out to sea. Ian Stroud from Porthcawl RNLI is their former deputy launch authoriser. He said: \"One of the most significant tasks a lifeboat station must undertake is observing sea conditions to make judgements on the equipment lifeboat operators will need. \"We wanted a view of the pier as it is such an important landmark.

Suffolk Police said the three young people aged between 16 and 18 were seen at Short Brackland at 04:20 BST on 24 September. They could be \"potential witnesses\", the force said. For updates on this story, visit BBC Suffolk Live. Acting Supt Kim Warner appealed to the trio: \"We appreciate that getting in touch with police may be intimidating but we do need to speak to you. \"At this stage in the investigation we just need to talk to anyone who may have seen Corrie during his night out so we can build a picture.\" One of the teenagers is described as a white female, of quite slim build, wearing either a dark green or navy blue jumper-style top. The other two were both males, one wearing a hooded top. They were seen towards the back of Cornhill Walk shopping centre, police said. Acting Supt Warner added: \"We need to find Corrie and a number of inquiries are being carried out to do this. \"We know from CCTV images that we have already viewed that he engaged with a number of people during his evening out. \"We have had several calls but still need to talk to anyone who may have seen him or spoken to him during the early hours.\" Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September. It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.",

    "source": "Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a \"manoeuvre\". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. \"We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership,\" he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. \"Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling.\" A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of \"irregularities\" in the text.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Writing in Lancet Global Health, they predict cases will rise from 36 million to 115 million by 2050, if treatment is not improved by better funding. A growing ageing population is behind the rising numbers. Some of the highest rates of blindness and vision impairment are in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of the world's population with visual impairments is actually falling, according to the study. But because the global population is growing and more people are living well into old age, researchers predict the number of people with sight problems will soar in the coming decades. Analysis of data from 188 countries suggests there are more than 200 million people with moderate to severe vision impairment. That figure is expected to rise to more than 550 million by 2050. \"Even mild visual impairment can significantly impact a person's life,\" said lead author Prof Rupert Bourne, from Anglia Ruskin University. \"For example, reducing their independence... as it often means people are barred from driving.\" He said it also limited people's educational and economic opportunities. The worst affected areas for visual impairment are in South and East Asia. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa also have particularly high rates. The study calls for better investment in treatments, such as cataract surgery, and ensuring people have access to appropriate vision-correcting glasses. Prof Rupert Bourne said: \"Interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment. \"They are some of the most easily implemented interventions in developing regions.\" \"They are cheap, require little infrastructure and countries recover their costs as people enter back into the workforce,\" he said. The charity Sightsavers, which works in more than thirty countries to try to eliminate avoidable blindness, says it is seeing a rise in conditions such as cataracts, where the eye's lens clouds over. \"Due to an ageing population and a rise in chronic disease, we expect the burden of blindness to only grow within the world's poorest countries\" said Imran Khan from the charity. He said health systems in developing countries need to be improved, and more surgeons and nurses need to be trained to deliver sustainable eye health care.",

Horan will take over from current president Aogan O Fearghail in 2018. \"Aogan is the president for the next 12 months so I'll support him and learn from him as best I can,\" said Horan at Croke Park. The other candidates for the post were Martin Skelly with 22 votes while 20 went to Robert Frost. This weekend's annual congress will be dominated by new championship proposals in football and hurling. The plans put forward by GAA director general Paraic Duffy include completing the All-Ireland Senior Championships by the end of August. Also included is a new round-robin format for the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals, which would mean more games. This proposal has proved particularly controversial in recent weeks. Both the Gaelic Players' Association and recently formed Club Players' Association have come out against Duffy's plans, although not necessarily for the same reasons. Ostensibly, the main reason for these mooted changes is to try and ensure more regular games for club players but there is a certain  amount of bafflement as to how this can be squared with the motion to have a round-robin stage in the All-Ireland Football quarter-finals. The new club players' body has been angered after the GAA's top brass refused to grant it a speaking platform at the Croke Park gathering. However, that may change at further annual gatherings of GAA delegates if a motion for the club players' body to be officially recognised is passed in Dublin. All the indications are that the votes on both the so-called new 'Super Eight football round' and the proposal to bring forward the All-Ireland finals will be exceptionally close, with a two-thirds' majority required for the format changes to be tried for a three-year period. To make matters even complicated, congress will also hear a number of motions calls from the two-thirds majority to be scrapped, with one call suggestion a simple majority and another calling for the figure to be lowered to 60%. Inevitably, those motions will require a two-thirds majority to be passed. Going into the weekend, Croke Park's desire for replays to be scrapped - in favour of extra-time - in all championship games bar provincial and All-Ireland finals looks likely to be comfortably passed. At last year's congress, motions to move All-Ireland Finals to earlier in the year and scrap replays were both defeated, although the finals proposal fell narrowly short after getting support from 60.8% of delegates.",

Avon and Somerset Police have named the victim as Matthew Symonds, 34, of no fixed address in Swindon, and said his death was being treated as unexplained. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later. His next of kin have been informed, police said. Det Ch Insp Gareth Bevan said officers were \"following several lines of inquiry\" to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death. \"Police inquiries so far suggest the body was transported with commercial recycling waste collected in Swindon and therefore the focus of the investigation will be in that area going forward,\" he said. \"The investigation is at an early stage and we are keeping an open mind about the circumstances leading to this man's death.\" Police said it was too early to say how long the body parts had been there. Biffa is one of the country's leading waste management companies, disposing of rubbish from commercial, industrial and public sector organisations. Matthew Humphreys, from the company, said: \"I can confirm that a body was received at our Avonmouth Transfer Station during the morning of Friday 1st August. \"Biffa takes health and safety very seriously and is conducting its own internal investigation, into the circumstances surrounding the incident.\"",

Instead, the executive pays the cost of \u00c2\u00a3280m a year to NI Water. Further legislation is expected to extend the policy. However, the decision could mean that the authorities are not complying with European rules on water quality. The EU Water Framework Directive envisages that users should pay for their water to promote conservation. Officials in Northern Ireland make the case that people do that through their regional rate. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK not to levy a charge on homes, although businesses do pay charges. That has prompted a debate with calls for the introduction of a charge on homes to pay for improvements in infrastructure. Now, the European Commission has opened a so-called \"pilot case\" to look at the issue. Essentially, this is a way for the commission to establish whether EU rules are being correctly applied. It allows for the commission and member states to resolve any conflicts without resorting to infringement proceedings. The Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it could not comment on the detail of the case. \"It is the subject of a confidential dialogue with the Commission and the release of further details could potentially prejudice the outcome of those discussions,\" said the department. The two sides get about 20 weeks to try and sort out their differences. Many cases are resolved without going to a formal hearing.",

The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing. She will serve as her father's \"eyes and ears\" while providing broad-ranging advice, her attorney told Politico. Ms Trump, who owns a fashion brand, will join husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president. The US first daughter said in a statement: \"While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees. \"I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life.\" After Mr Kushner's White House appointment was announced, Ms Trump said she would focus on settling her family in Washington rather than work for the administration. Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son. Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: \"Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.\" But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title. Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: \"I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. \"But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.\" The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's \"special hiring authority\". Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an \"unfair advantage\" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.",

The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes. As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:. Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes. The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit. He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election. Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget. But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes. Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term. Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush. In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket. But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit. Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative. In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007. In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich. Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart). Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media. He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally. But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956. Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children. Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992. He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008. Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack. The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket. But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House. When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith. And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language. Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate. Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters. Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing. Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time. His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response. Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC. While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008. John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004. The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates. Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them. In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate. Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school. He served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.",

    "source": "At a rally in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Mr Huckabee used the phrase \"hope to higher ground\" as a motif. The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited...  and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, as well as former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Jeb Bush has not officially announced but is the frontrunner in the party.",

The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015. Ms Olcay said the items would be bought elsewhere if she did not sell them. Admitting that she was taking part in the trade, she alleged that local Turkish authorities were also involved. She said others would have taken her place if she stopped selling supplies to the migrants. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that while honorary consuls are not members of the diplomatic corps, the news will be a big embarrassment to the French foreign ministry. The reporter on France 2 TV who uncovered the news had been investigating where migrants in Bodrum were purchasing their supplies. His inquiries brought him to a large store, with a French flag flying outside and a sign at the entrance saying \"French honorary consul\". Ms Olcay confirmed she was the consul, and that she sold boats to the migrants despite knowing it could lead to disaster. She told the reporter that it was wrong but everyone was doing it. Thousands of refugees have used Bodrum as a gateway to fulfil their dream of reaching Europe. However, correspondents say the number of nightly departures appears to have slightly decreased after Turkish police stepped up patrols in the wake of the death of Alan Kurdi. The body of the three-year-old was washed up at Bodrum last week, after he drowned along with his mother, four-year-old brother and nine other Syrians as they attempted to sail to the Greek island of Kos.

    "source": "Dean Owens, from Leith, knew that his great great grandfather Ambrose Salvona was buried somewhere in Inverness. After telling this to his audience at Perth's Southern Fried Festival, Inverness resident Judi Menabney came forward and offered to find the grave. Salvona's resting place has since been found in Tomnahurich Cemetery. Owens' research of his family tree influenced the writing of Dora, a track on his Nashville-recorded album Into the Sea. The song is about his grandmother, Dora Salvona Owens, who grew up in a circus that Salvona started in Scotland. Salvona was thought to have arrived in Scotland from Italy in the company of a dancing bear, sometime in the late 19th Century. Owens' lyrics of the song include the lines: \"Somewhere way back there's a lion tamer/Ambrose and his dancing bear/He's buried in the Highlands/but we're not sure where.\" Ms Menabney works for High Life Highland, an organisation that runs archives, registration and family history services on Highland Council's behalf. With help from her colleagues at the Highland Archive and Registration Centre in Inverness she was able to find the grave in one of the city's largest cemeteries. Family historian Anne Fraser said: \"It was great fun investigating Ambrose's story. \"He turns out to have been a very colourful character - which may not be a surprise - but we have also finished up raising as many questions as we've answered.\" The staff at the centre found out that Salvona was married twice and was the father of at least 10 children. He was 80 when he first arrived in Inverness and was, at the end of his life at the age of 88, a resident of a poor house that later became Hilton Hospital and is today a block of flats. Salvona appears to been a popular figure in the Highland town. A procession of people carried his body to a prominent position at Tomnahurich following his death on 13 October 1917. The inscription on the gravestone acknowledges his career as a lion tamer. Owens said: \"I can't believe the final resting place of my great great grandfather has been found. \"I'm very grateful to Judi, Anne and their colleagues for all the work they've put into discovering his story. \"I'm delighted they want to use it and my song Dora - which started the search - in their own presentations.\" The singer added: \"You really don't know what's up there, way up in the family tree.

She used \u00a311,072 of NHS cash to pay her husband Stephen, 46, for work on an equality and diversity publication called Transform, which never existed. Her husband also changed his plea to admit fraud. More on the fraud case and other stories from Devon and Cornwall. Former nurse Vasco-Knight, of Runcorn, Cheshire, shook and sobbed uncontrollably as she changed her plea to one of the two charges of fraud she faced. Recorder Don Tait adjourned sentence until March but warned the Vasco-Knights that a \"custodial sentence is a distinct possibility\". He told the jury: \"As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility.\" Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred. The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard. But it was a \"sham\", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting. He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a \"massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive\". Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter. Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting. The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling \u00a39,000 from the NHS. She and her husband were released on bail to 10 March for sentencing. Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been \"an inspiration to so many\" and her fraud was a \"huge disappointment and shock to many\".",

He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs \"being returned from Wales in large numbers\". \"We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales,\" he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. \"I don't think we will be wiped out here,\" he said. \"We've got a good record in government ... we're directly engaged in our local communities,\" he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was \"appalled\" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the \"triple lock\" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a \"more open relationship\" with the EU than a \"hard\" Brexit, calling for \"full and unfettered\" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was \"economically beneficial\". \"There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment,\" he said. \"I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants.\" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: \"A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves.\"",

A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of \u00c2\u00a350,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white Seat Leon car, which sped off along West Nile Street towards the Cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in Scott Street, near Stow College. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on West Nile Street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities. Det Insp Alasdair Barlow said: \"We are reviewing CCTV images in and around the city centre. \"We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist. \"As the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed.\"",

    "source": "Sergeant Randy Johnson, 34, was killed in an explosion near Baghdad in 2007, Woolwich Crown Court heard. The fingerprints of Anis Abid Sardar, from Wembley, London, were allegedly found on two other bombs at the scene, but not that which killed Sgt Johnson. Mr Sardar, 38, denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: \"This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will see and hear comes from Iraq. \"The Crown's case is that the defendant Mr Sardar was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. \"As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city Damascus at relevant times.\" He explained that although the offences took place in Iraq, Mr Sardar is on trial in London as a British citizen. Mr Hill said the bombs \"were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent\". They were later taken to an FBI laboratory in the US for examination by experts. Sgt Johnson, of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, was killed when the armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit a roadside improvised explosive device (IED). Other US soldiers were seriously injured by the blast and also in a fire-fight while dealing with another IED, the court heard. Fingerprints found on the bomb that killed Sgt Johnson belonged to another man, Sajjad Adnan, who worked with Mr Sardar, the prosecution said. Mr Adnan, who is not British, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after the bombings and his current whereabouts are unknown, Mr Hill said. Jurors heard Mr Sardar was part of a group that left a number of IEDs buried under the roads west of Baghdad. The bomb that killed Sgt Johnson was part of a sequence, Mr Hill told the court, \"involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together\". Mr Hill said the bomb series was part of a  \"joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others\". \"That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sgt Johnson,\" he said. The prosecution made clear that this was an \"unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence... comes from Iraq.\" Nevertheless it is, according to them, lawful to try Anis Sardar here because he is a British citizen who lives and works in London. It is the first time we have seen a prosecution in this country for charges of making improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the insurgency in Iraq. This has been a case a long time in gestation, since Mr Sardar was arrested seven years after the bombs were recovered from a dusty road west of Baghdad. The jury was told they were forensically analysed by the US authorities in Iraq and America before being examined by British scientists. Though Mr Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria in 2007 to learn Arabic, the court heard that police found documents in his London home which suggested he already had an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found a bomb-making manual written in Arabic. The US-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, amid claims Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It sparked years of violent conflict with different groups competing for power. British forces ended combat operations in 2009 and the US did so the following year. A total of 179 UK service personnel and nearly 4,500 US soldiers were killed during the conflict.",

The Kremlin has accused Nato of stoking tensions by expanding eastwards. Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Baltic warning over Russian move on Nato. Missile deployment in Kaliningrad ups the stakes for Nato. In October, Russia sent nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a move Poland described as of the \"highest concern\". Russia said the deployment was part of military exercises and had happened before. The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad represents an important military outpost between Poland and Lithuania with its coastline on the Baltic Sea. The accumulation of radars and air defence systems, as well as coastal anti-shipping missiles, all form part of Moscow's developing \"anti-access and area denial strategy\", which in essence seeks to push Nato forces away from Russia and to make it very difficult to reinforce Nato members in the Baltic region in the event of a crisis. However, in a separate statement on Monday, the RIA news agency quoted Russian defence committee chairman Viktor Ozerov as saying Iskanders and S-400 surface-to-air missiles were deployed in Kaliningrad to counter a planned US missile defence shield in eastern Europe. The Bastion system fires Oniks cruise missiles, which have a range of up to 280 miles (450km). Russia has already used them in the Syrian civil war where it is supporting President Bashar al-Assad. On Tuesday, Nato urged greater transparency on military activities \"to avoid incidents and the risk of misunderstandings\". US state department spokesman John Kirby also called the latest Russian moves \"destabilising to European security\". Kaliningrad profile. \"Russia has made threats to move its Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad for the past decade in response to a variety of developments in Europe, none of which demand such a military response,\" he said. \"We call on Russia to refrain from words or deeds that are inconsistent with the goal of promoting security and stability.\" His comments brought a stinging rebuke from the Russian defence ministry, which said that \"all recent threats to European security\" were a consequence of US military policy.",

Jones said: \"We target players all the time. That's part of rugby isn't it? \"I'm not saying Sexton is a weak defender, but we're going to target players because we want to win.\" Jones added that coaches have picked out particular opposition players in their tactical plans \"since Adam was a boy\", revealing that he had told his players to run at England fly-half Jonny Wilkinson's injured right shoulder when coaching Australia in the 2003 World Cup final. The treatment meted out to fly-half Sexton in Paris - including an off-the-ball shoulder charge by second row Yoann Maestri early in the first half - was criticised by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. Maestri escaped a ban after the incident was reviewed by the citing commissioner. Sexton was diagnosed with whiplash injuries to his neck and shoulder after the match. Media playback is not supported on this device. Jones said that he wanted England to be \"brutal\" but legal in his first match at Twickenham since taking charge of England in November. He said: \"It's not illegal to target someone. I don't want our players to do anything illegal in terms of the laws. We want to be physical, fair and brutal. \"They've talked about him having whiplash injuries, which isn't a great thing to talk about. I'm sure his mother and father would be worried about that.\" Captain Dylan Hartley added: \"If there's a weak defender in the team, you put your best ball carrier at that weak defender. But a weak defender could be a lazy tight-head whose legs have gone. It's not because they're physically weak, it can be for other reasons.\" Sexton spent 12 weeks on the sidelines between November 2014 and February 2015 as part of a enforced lay-off following a four concussions in a year while playing his club rugby for Racing Metro in France. Some media commentators have called for Sexton to consider retiring to protect his long-term health with 69% of readers responding to an online poll by the Irish Independent newspaper suggesting he should stop playing. Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Radio 5 live that Jones' comments were \"refreshing\". Dawson said: \"Of course he has not overstepped the mark. That is the way that it is. Every single meeting between England and Ireland, they will have been targeting players they think are weak.\"",

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would \"consult before any building\". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said \"scientifically tested charcoal\" dug up from the site had \"revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC\". David Jacques said the dig had also found \"evidence of feasting\" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: \"British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. \"Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. \"But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could \"provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.\" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. \"English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.\"",

    "source": "Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards. Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures. But Hanson Academy claims it \"communicated clearly\" its expectations for this school year. Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed. Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday. She said in an earlier statement: \"We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted. \"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason. \"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.\" The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \"adult life\". She said: \"This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect. \"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other. \"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.\" Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes. She said: \"It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather.\" She said buying new shoes was not an easy option. \"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important.\" Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps. \"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes,\" she said. Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home. Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: \"Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00. \"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon.\" The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents. She said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately.",

As part of the deal to sell 24-year-old De Gea to Real, United were planning to bring Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas, 28, in the opposite direction. There is no precedent for Spanish clubs being given additional time to conclude transfers as there is in England. Blame for the failure to complete the deal is already being apportioned. Reports in Spain claim United were responsible for the deal collapsing. The line is they did not get their paperwork to Spanish Football Federation headquarters until a minute after the 23:00 BST deadline. United say they have a receipt that proves they submitted the relevant documents in time. It remains to be seen whether Real will appeal to world governing body Fifa, which is responsible for sanctioning international transfers. The internet naturally had its say... And the tweets only intensified once stories of a technical glitch at the Madrid end began to surface... If Real Madrid don't appeal, or do appeal and fail to push the transfer through, he'll be back at Old Trafford competing for a place in the United starting line-up. Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, has started all six of United's games so far this season, with Sam Johnstone on the substitutes' bench. The Red Devils still have Victor Valdes after his move to Besiktas collapsed, but he has fallen out with manager Louis van Gaal. De Gea, who has not played for United this season, must first turn his attention to international duty with Spain. They have two Euro 2016 qualifying matches to negotiate, at home to Slovakia on 5 September and in Macedonia on 8 September. They seem pretty relaxed about it all. If De Gea stays, they have a world-class keeper to call on. If he goes, the Navas deal could still happen. Unlike Real, United have a few more hours to do their business. The transfer window may be shut in Spain, but it remains open until 18:00 BST on Tuesday for Premier League clubs. Monday was mostly about letting players leave... But the move that caught a lot of people by surprise involved a French teenager named Anthony Martial. It appears United are willing to pay as much as \u00a336m to get him. A 19-year-old Monaco striker with plenty of potential. He has even been likened to Thierry Henry. Nevertheless, \u00a336m is a lot to pay for a teenager. According to French football journalist Philippe Auclair, the size of the transfer fee has left \"people speechless in France\". \"He's got good technique, good skills, he's a good finisher, but he is still a raw product,\" added Auclair. \"We don't know how far he can go.\"",

Cardiff council's Labour group said it was \"willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue\". The Mayor for Cardiff campaign was launched earlier this year with a budget of more than \u00c2\u00a320,000. Daran Hill, from the campaign, said at the time that an elected mayor was a \"new, fresh idea\" that could \"energise the people of Cardiff\". There are currently 17 directly-elected mayors in England with more on the way, but there are none in Wales. Mr Govier, a councillor for Cardiff's Grangetown ward, said the debate has \"moved on\" and a regional mayor was now needed. \"We're not going to hit the target, especially because the council refused to allow online petitions,\" he said. \"We feel we've moved the debate on and the focus now needs to switch to a regional mayor for south east Wales. We have to go bigger.\" Mr Govier claimed the Cardiff Capital Region City Deal - a funding package agreed between UK, Welsh and local government worth \u00c2\u00a31.2bn over 20 years - was beginning to stall \"because of governance\". \"The region has to work together on infrastructure and transport,\" he said. \"A regional mayor is needed.\" He added there are \"sympathetic ears throughout the region and across political parties\". Ceredigion is the only Welsh local authority to have had a referendum on the matter. Voters there rejected the idea in 2004 by a margin of nearly three to one. A spokeswoman for Cardiff council's Labour group said: \"Cardiff Labour are willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue, and as we have seen there is very little interest in introducing a further level of bureaucracy. \"The City Deal is definitely not stalling and is moving forward, despite uncertainty caused by Brexit. \"It will be a huge boost for Cardiff and the region, and suggestions to the contrary are just mischief making.\" A Wales Office spokesman said: \"The Cardiff City Deal is the biggest of its kind in the UK and we are confident this ambitious project is on target.\" The Welsh Government declined to comment in response to Mr Govier's comments.",

Satisfaction with the work of councils is highest in North East England - but still less than one in three are happy. People have rated councils better than national government in past studies. Voters will go to the polls on 5 May to elect more than 9,500 councillors in nearly 280 councils across England. Research by polling firm YouGov, designed to coincide with the election campaign, has suggested that the majority of voters casting their ballots next month will do so not knowing any of the candidates. It asked more than 2,000 people aged over 18 across the UK whether they could name any of their local councillors. Recognition was highest in Scotland, where 47% of those canvassed were able to identify one of their local representatives. In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46%, while in Wales, the figure was 44%. Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43%. But in six regions - the East Midlands, the East of England, the West Midlands, London, the south west of England and the south east - less than one in three of those asked could identify the person representing them. Asked whether the local authority addressed the needs of their local communities, only 20% of people living in the North West of England said it did. Approval levels were highest in the North East (31%), the West Midlands (28%) and Wales (27%). Social networking site Streetlife, which commissioned the research, suggested it demonstrated there was a \"real disconnection\" between residents of local communities and those representing them. The findings contrast with those of the Hansard Society, whose recent audit of political engagement concluded that awareness and satisfaction with local politics had increased since last year's general election. It found that more than two out of three people were interested in how local services were provided and nearly half believed they were being delivered well - much higher than at a national level. The Hansard Society also found name recognition was also a problem for national politicians, with only 38% of people able to name their own MP. But its research suggested that interest in local politics did not translate into a wish to become involved - with only one in ten people saying their were likely to volunteer in their communities over the next couple of years. Elections are taking place next month in 36 metropolitan boroughs, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield, as well as 49 unitary authorities and 194 district councils - the biggest test of popular opinion since last year's general election.

    "source": "Ministers shelved Wednesday's vote on relaxing hunting laws in England and Wales after the SNP said it would vote against the changes. The party had previously said it would not vote on issues affecting England and Wales only. Mr Cameron said the SNP's position was \"entirely opportunistic\". Downing Street said it was \"disappointing\" that the vote had to be postponed, and said new proposals on the Hunting Act would be introduced \"in due course\". The government has said the hunting vote will now be held after plans to give English MPs a veto on matters affecting only England - although this would not stop the hunting issue having to be voted on by the whole House of Commons. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the decision to delay the hunting vote showed \"David Cameron can't carry his own parliamentary group\", and that he only had a \"slender and fragile\" majority. She said he had also been forced to pull his English votes for English laws plans, showing that he was \"not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons\". She said if he \"had any sense\", he would come back with proposals based on \"fairness and reasonableness\" that \"work in both directions\". Earlier she had explained her party's decision to take part in the hunting vote, saying there had been \"overwhelming demand\" from people in England. Another reason, she said, was because David Cameron was making Scottish MPs \"second-class citizens\" in the House of Commons. Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent. With two strategic retreats in the space of a week, the intersection of Hunting and English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) is generating some really interesting politics. Last week, the government paused its attempt to bring in EVEL, replacing a vote on Wednesday with a consultative debate. Today another \"turn your back and run away, and live to fight another day\" moment on the proposed changes to the Hunting Act. Read the blog in full. The government plans to change Commons rules to allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs a \"decisive say\" on legislation only applying there. However, the current proposals would not prevent SNP MPs from voting against the changes. Downing Street said there were no plans to change the current proposals. This is because the statutory instrument ministers want to use to change the law would require the support of the whole of the House of Commons. The government's decision to reschedule the vote came as anti-hunting protesters gathered at the Houses of Parliament to protest against changing the law. The changes would have brought the Hunting Act in line with Scotland, where an unlimited number of dogs can be used to \"flush out\" a fox to be shot, compared to just two in England and Wales. It's been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: they could hunt without their every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: it was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and they only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, their fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn't a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government's desire to change the Hunting Act. They are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government's change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday's free vote. The SNP says it will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales. Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: \"David Cameron is now running scared because he knew he was going to lose the vote on fox-hunting.\" Meanwhile, a poll for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has suggested almost three in four British adults are against making fox hunting legal. The poll, conducted by ComRes, asked 1,005 people if the practice \"should or should not be made legal again?\".",

    "source": "One of the highest ranking military officials of his time, more than 30 places around the world now bear his name. In Guernsey, where he was governor for 24 years, a school, a road and a former hospital were named after him. However, in the US Lord Amherst has become a dubious figure because of his connection with biological warfare. Earlier this year students at liberal arts institution Amherst College, Massachusetts, voted to remove 'Lord Jeff' as their unofficial mascot in light of accusations he approved the wiping out of Native Americans by deliberately giving them smallpox via infected blankets. As the commander-in-chief of the British army in pre-independence north America, Jeffery Amherst is said to have \"both despised and hated his enemy\" according to the historian Henry Morse Stephens. In a postscript to a fellow British officer Henry Bouquet, he appears to have written: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race. \"I should be very glad your scheme for hunting them down by dogs could take effect, but England is at too great a distance to think of that at present.\" Other higher education institutions including the University of Cape Town and Oxford University have faced student protests because of their association with another colonial figure, the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes.  The 'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign led to UCT removing a statue of the 19th Century politician. Professor Elizabeth Fenn, an historian at the University of Colorado, who researched the Amherst smallpox incident told the BBC: \"I am relieved and delighted to see the wholehearted rejection of Jeffery Amherst. \"He advocated genocide, the 'total erxtirpation' of native peoples. The question we should ask is why did it take us so long?\" In Montreal more than 6,500 people signed an online petition to rename the city's Amherst Street after a former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, who died in 2015. The campaign, launched that year, continues. Some researchers have argued that the British general deserves an honourable position in history for his personal achievements, one of which was the capture of Montreal in 1760. Morse Stephens wrote: \"Though not a great man... his personal qualities were undeniable, and he could not have been an ordinary man to have risen from page to Duke of Dorset to be field-marshal commanding-in-chief.\" Whether Sir Jeffery Amherst ever visited Guernsey during his time as governor of the island is not known, but his legacy lives on today in several places; Amherst Primary School, Amherst Road and the Amherst Room at Castle Cornet. There was an Amherst Maternity Hospital in St Peter Port but the site was redeveloped for housing. Local historian, Colonel Richard Graham, said that Lord Amherst had been viewed as a national hero \"in whose reflected glory Guernsey bathed over the 24 years of his time in office\". So have recent events overseas had any bearing on the general's reputation in Guernsey? Mr Graham said historical figures like Jeffery Amherst should be judged by the standards of their time. \"I believe strongly that they should be judged and accepted by the mores of the time they lived rather than by ours. \"In a hundred years' time, our actions will be similarly scrutinised and there will be some judgemental souls who will see evil in stuff we currently regard as harmless. \"That is not to say that hideous conduct as seen in the evils of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot are any the less hideous for having taken place when they did and within the world as it was. \"But even these abominations need to be explained and understood as if from their time if the appropriate lessons are to be drawn from history.\" The island's Education Department and a St Peter Port Parish official told the BBC that no one had approached them about renaming local places called Amherst.",

    "source": "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65% to 17% majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38% of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5% of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish\". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.",

The star is also set for a US number one, after selling roughly 450,000 downloads in 48 hours. The song's video, which also premiered on Friday, has been watched more than 70 million times on YouTube. Directed by Canadian film-maker Xavier Dolan, the video sees Adele raking the coals of a faded relationship. Her ex-boyfriend is played in flashback scenes by Tristan Wilds, a former child actor from acclaimed crime series The Wire, who released his own Grammy-nominated album,  New York: A Love Story, in 2013. According to Entertainment Weekly, it is also the first music video to be shot with large-format IMAX cameras. Hello is the lead single from Adele's third album, 25, which is due out on 20 November. Reviews for the single have been overwhelmingly positive. The Guardian called it \"striking, witty and lovelorn\"; while the Telegraph described it as \"a beautiful song of loss and regret\". Following its release on Friday, it topped the iTunes chart in 102 countries, and the album topped the pre-order chart in 93 countries. In the UK, Hello is expected to have the biggest opening week of the year, beating Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do, which achieved 173,000 combined sales and streams in February. The star could also smash a US record for selling the most downloads in a single week - set in 2009 when Flo Rida's Right Round was bought 636,000 times. Such figures emphasise the importance of Adele's career in an ailing music industry. She is one of the remaining few artists - others include Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Ed Sheeran - who can convince fans to pay for their records. Her last album, 21, sold 30 million copies worldwide, and it is hoped that its follow-up, 25, will mirror that success. If so, it could help reverse figures from the first half of this year, which showed that sales of both CDs and digital albums had fallen in the UK. But, speaking last Friday, Adele told the BBC she was not feeling the weight of expectation. \"I feel like every album I'm ever going to write is always going to be following 21,\" she said. \"No matter what this album does, my next record's going to be following 21. \"It's phenomenal what happened with that - but it is a phenomenon. I can't really include it in any expectations of anything I ever do again.\"",

Leakey's extreme measures to tackle poachers, including sending helicopter gunships into the national park, have helped Kenya's elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when a stockpile of 12 tonnes of ivory was burned in Nairobi National Park. Jolie said Africa is about \"a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of man's footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him\". Producer David Ellison - whose company Skydance co-produced films including True Grit and Jack Reacher - called Leakey \"inspirational,\" adding, \"Africa is a story that deserves to be told\".

    "source": "A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. \"Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,\" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are \"pervasive\" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. \"We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,\" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. \"When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,\" Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. \"EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,\" the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.",

In total, the number of respondents with no more than a high-school diploma who said they were \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay\" fell to 60% from 61%. Overall, the annual survey showed US economic health improving. Some 70% of respondents said they were either \"living comfortably\" or \"doing okay,\" up from 69% the year before, and 62% in 2013 when the Federal Reserve started the survey. But there were continuing signs of instability, with over a third of US households (35%) saying they could not cover their monthly bills or an unexpected $400 (\u00c2\u00a3307) expense, according to the survey. The survey also suggested that disparities between households with different education levels was growing. Gap between rich and poor 'keeps growing' Enriching the rich in the US - but what about the rest? \"A clear pattern over the past two years across these measures is that the improvements have been most pronounced among those with greater levels of education,\" researchers wrote in the report. Nearly 100 million Americans have no education beyond high school, according to US government estimates. (The estimate excludes members of the military and people in institutional facilities such as prison.) That fact is tied to wide differences, the survey found. About 46% of adults with at least a college degree reported family incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to just 9% of respondents with a high school degree or less. Adults with at least a college degree were more likely to report earning money from online activities - such as renting out properties using a website - and more likely to have a steady stream of income from month-to-month. They were also more likely to say they received a raise in the last year, and more likely to say it exceeded the growth in their expenses. \"The thing is that earnings are so highly correlated with education and employment,\" said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. \"It's hard to imagine how a sense of financial wellbeing would not be correlated with education.\" Jobs in sectors that once supplied well-paid work for school leavers,  such as manufacturing, have fallen. At the same time, the overall labour market has become more unstable as employers cut back on benefits and pay rises. The share of Americans in the workforce is also shrinking - particularly among those with lower levels of education, said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"The workers we would expect to have the strongest labour attachments have actually been becoming less attached,\" she said. Among survey respondents who did not attend college, nearly 40% said it was too expensive or that they needed to earn money. Their status was also closely tied to whether their parents had attended college. But Ms Baum said simply getting everyone to go to college is not the solution. \"There could be more work done to equalise things at the level of higher education but the problem is never going to be solved just at the college level,\" she said.",

She admitted public indecency along with three other western tourists, one Dutch and two Canadians, and was imprisoned for three days. All four have now left the island. Noor Alam Khan Abdul Wahid Khan, the immigration department director of the Malaysian state Sabah, told the BBC Hawkins left Kota Kinabalu for Kuala Lumpur at 17:35 local time (10:35 BST) on Malaysia Airlines. The other three, Dutch national Dylan Snel, 23, and Canadian siblings Lindsey, 23, and Danielle Peterson, 22, left earlier on Saturday for Kuala Lumpur. Hawkins, whose sentence was back-dated to reflect time already served, was also fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (\u00c2\u00a3860/$1,330) on Friday. She and her co-accused all admitted a charge of \"committing an obscene act in public\". Hawkins, who is from the Derbyshire village of Draycott, said she had been \"stupid and disrespectful\". Prosecutors said the four tourists, along with six others, climbed the peak to enjoy the sunrise on 30 May and then challenged each other to take off their clothes and pose for photographs. The move caused widespread offence in the region and was regarded as the cause of a magnitude 5.9 earthquake near the mountain, which is considered sacred. The earthquake, on 5 June, killed 18 people, including children, and left hundreds more stranded. Sabah state deputy chief minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan blamed it on the travellers showing \"disrespect to the sacred mountain\".",

It is calling for faster broadband access for homes and business. A government spokesperson said most UK homes can get \"superfast\" broadband. \"Almost nine out of ten UK properties has access to superfast speeds and 95% of the UK will be reached by 2017,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC. But the IoD believes the target should be higher and is calling for speeds of 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) by 2030, 1,000 times faster than the current official aim of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) by 2020. \"Now is the time to set a bold new target for genuinely world-beating broadband,\" said Dan Lewis, senior advisor on Infrastructure Policy at the IoD, and author of the report. \"We have the leading internet economy in the G20, and yet download speeds are mediocre and the coverage of fibre optic cable is woeful.\" He added: \"Unfortunately, the Government's current target displays a distinct poverty of ambition.\" Mr Lewis said the government needed to look at how the UK could provide the physical infrastructure needed to maintain a position \"at the forefront of digital innovation in business\". IoD members interviewed for the report said that better broadband speeds could increase their company's productivity, make them more competitive, and enable them to offer more flexible working to their staff. The IoD report comes just days after communications watchdog Ofcom said BT must open up its cable network and allow competition to improve UK internet connections. Ofcom also said there was a digital divide in the UK between those with the latest technologies, and those without. It has proposed that decent, affordable broadband should be a universal right. Rivals had called for a split between BT and its Openreach operation, which runs its cables, fibre and network infrastructure. Companies such as Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk, who pay to use the network, had claimed that BT underinvested in Openreach, leading to a poor service with interruptions and slow speeds.",

    "source": "The French artist cut out paper shapes for collages when ill-health prevented him from painting, producing famous pieces such as The Snail and Blue Nude. The Daily Telegraph said the London gallery must know it has a \"winner\" with its \"outstanding\" exhibition. \"I eat it with my eyes and never feel sated,\" said The Guardian's critic. Many of the items will be seen together for the first time in the exhibition, which opens on Thursday and features about 130 artworks from the latter stage of Matisse's career. The Telegraph said that \"the joy of the cut-outs is their simplicity\". The paper's critic said the artworks were made from \"modest materials\" using \"basic techniques\" but that the artist \"reduces art to the essentials of colour, shape and pattern\". \"Yet precisely because they offer us instant visual gratification, it is easy to forget how innovative they actually are,\" he wrote. The Guardian added that the show was \"ravishing, filled with light and decoration, exuberance and a kind of violence\" adding that it was \"about more than just pleasure\". \"Matisse created a universe that filled the room around him, spilling from the walls to the floor.\" Matisse worked from a wheelchair after treatment for cancer and the exhibition compiles work dating from 1937 to 1954, when he died aged 84 of a heart attack. Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate director and co-curator of the show, told the BBC the works displayed great skill. \"Cut-out sounds a bit simplistic, they are very sophisticated objects. \"The brilliance is that he took the method of a child and deployed it with all the sophistication of an artist who had been painting for 60 years.\" He said that the artworks were \"incredibly influential\" on a generation of American painters in the 60s and 70s. \"The colour is really intense, the colour is brilliant, it's really not quite what we associate with the immediate post-war years in Europe. He's really on his own.\" The Economic Voice added that the exhibition \"re-examines the cut-outs in terms of the methods and materials that Matisse used, and their double lives, first as contingent and mutable in the studio and ultimately as permanent works through mounting and framing\". The exhibition will be at the London gallery until 7 September before it travels to New York's Museum of Modern Art in mid-October. It can also be seen by cinema-goers from 3 June with the launch of Matisse Live.",

    "source": "The clashes, between Sunni pro- and anti-Syrian groups, followed the shooting dead on Sunday of two anti-Syrian clerics. The violence is the first in Beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring Syria in March last year. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident shows how divided the Lebanese are over the Syrian crisis. It follows a week of clashes in the northern city of Tripoli between anti-Syrian Sunnis and Alawites who support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria, the dominant partner, had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years, finally withdrawing soldiers in 2005, but maintaining a strong influence. Political factions in Lebanon have often defined themselves as pro- or anti-Syrian. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut. Given how deeply and sharply Lebanon is divided over Syria, it's a miracle that there hasn't been much more violence than there has. But the killing of two Sunni clerics at a Lebanese Army checkpoint in the north of the country on Sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater. Only in Beirut did the tension break into open conflict. And it was restricted to a clash between Sunni groups, with the mainstream Future faction of Saad al-Hariri using the occasion to squeeze out the small, pro-Syrian Arab Movement Party, whose leader Shaker Berjawi fled. In nearby areas of south Beirut, Hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of it. Political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint, while the government pledged a vigorous enquiry into the death of the two shaikhs. Divisions over Syria are the defining issue in Lebanese politics. Everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to erupt freely onto the streets. Sunday's violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two Sunni sheikhs linked to the anti-Syrian Future movement, headed by opposition leader Saad al-Hariri, at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the north on Sunday. Supporters of Mr Hariri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres, but security forces intervened to clear them. In Beirut's southern district of Tariq al-Jadideh, offices of a local pro-Syrian leader came under attack by gunmen. Rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire were heard for much of the night. But the clashes died away after the leader, Shaker Berjawi, left the area, and the Lebanese Army moved in. Sunni religious and political leaders have called for the utmost restraint, and an investigation has been launched into the killing of the two sheikhs. Correspondents say there are fears of a return to the violence seen in clashes between Sunni and Shia Muslims in 2008 which brought the country close to civil war.",

At least 24 people have been killed in violence since the 8 August election, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has said. Mr Odinga said the poll was rigged to give President Uhuru Kenyatta victory, and called for a \"day of mourning for the fallen patriots\". However, Kenyans on Twitter have been using the hashtag #TurudiKaziniChallenge (Swahili for \"Let's return to work\" ) to urge a return to normalcy following last week's disruptions. Mr Kenyatta repeated his appeal for peace. \"At the end of the day we are all Kenyans, we don't need to fight one  another, we don't need to destroy each other's property, we don't need to take  life,\" he said in a statement. \"Kenyans have said that the election is behind them, the majority have  returned to work,\" he added. Young people have been burning tyres in Kibera, a Nairobi slum where Mr Odinga has strong support, reports the BBC's Tomi Oladipo from the scene. However, some of Mr Odinga's supporters in Kibera have opened their shops, saying that while they agree with him that the result was rigged, they cannot afford to lose business, our reporter adds. Businesses are open as usual in the coastal city of Mombasa. In the western city of Kisumu, a stronghold of Mr Odinga, there has been a mixed response to the strike, with shops open in some areas and shut in others. The official results gave President Kenyatta about 54% of the vote, and Mr Odinga 45%. \"This is a failed regime that is resorting to killing people instead of addressing the real issue. The vote was stolen. There's no secret about that,\" Mr Odinga told his supporters on Sunday, as he called for a strike. Foreign observers have declared the poll free and fair. European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are among those who have urged Mr Odinga to seek redress through the courts - something the opposition coalition says is not an option.",

They included the recruitment of 1,000 extra doctors and 5,000 nurses, the abolition of care home charges for the elderly and a proposal to pay off \u00a318,000 of university debt if students return to Wales. But the manifesto stretches far beyond the initial nine point plan, with a huge document some 194 pages long. Plaid promises to save 10,000 lives between 2016 and 2026 through a range of measures, including action on public health actions and promoting individual lifestyle changes. They include ensuring earlier diagnosis of disease and better access to life-saving treatments. \"Overall we will reduce preventable deaths by 25% by 2026,\" the manifesto says. And in a major shake-up to how the NHS is run, Plaid says it will fully integrate primary, community and adult social care. It says it would create a \"National Network of Acute and Specialist Hospitals\", and consult on whether this will be run directly by the Welsh Government's Department of Health or by an arms-length NHS Board. Community health services, such as GPs' surgeries, district nurses and mental health, would be run by local government. Local health boards would be replaced with a \"Community NHS\" system delivered through new Regional Combined Authorities - new strategic bodies that will provide strategic planning for local government. Plaid Cymru thinks the current tuition fee grant scheme is unsustainable and wants to end it and replace it with an entirely new system. In its manifesto the party says it will reform student finance so that Welsh students who work in Wales after graduation will receive \u00a36,000 a year, up to a maximum of \u00a318,000. Plaid also wants to:. Plaid Cymru promises a \"national economic plan\" to put Wales on a par with the rest of the UK \"within a generation\". It says it aims to close the 30% income gap that has opened up between Wales and the rest of the UK within the \"medium-term\". As well as that, the manifesto promises to restore the Welsh Development Agency to promote trade and investment in Wales. Plaid says it would:. Plaid Cymru is backing the blue route \"or a variation of it\" to improve the M4. It also says it will invest in improvements to the A55. It also pledges to:. Plaid says it will \"produce proposals\" for the reform of the present council tax system into a domestic property tax, which the party says would be fairer for those in less expensive properties. Partial powers on income tax are due to be devolved in the next assembly term - and Plaid is pledging not to increase it. The party says replacing council tax would allow the scope to introduce a middle rate of income tax which will be lower than the current UK higher rate of 40%. Plaid also promising to raise the stamp duty threshold from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3145,000, which the manifesto says would remove \"over half of all buyers out of tax altogether\". The party says it will:. Plaid Cymru say they will 're-direct' more than \u00a31bn of the Welsh Government's \u00a315bn budget through ending some schemes and finding savings elsewhere. These savings include:. That cash would be used to fund the party's programme, together withplanned increased to the Welsh Government's block grant by the UK Government. The constitution isn't devolved, but Plaid Cymru say they'd propose the establishment of a constitutional convention to put together a new framework for co-operation between the different parts of the UK. While its vision of Wales as a \"self-governing country within a confederation of equals\" is a medium-term aspiration, the party says independence remains a long-term aspiration. The manifesto says the party reserves \"the right to call a referendum in Wales on the principle of a confederal UK if the UK government refuses to establish a UK-wide convention\".

The directive, which takes effect on 16 March, places a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on all refugees. The previous order, which was blocked by a federal court, sparked confusion at airports and mass protests. \"Nothing of substance has changed: There is the same blanket ban on entry from Muslim-majority countries (minus one),\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said of the new order. It will bar entry of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. Iraq, which was included in the first ban, has been taken off the list. Mr Chin also said the directive included \"the same sweeping shutdown of refugee admissions (absent one exception) and lawless warren of exceptions and waivers\", despite the changes made. The new order lifts an indefinite ban on those from Syria. It will also no longer affect legal US permanent residents, and drops controversial language about giving priority to religious minorities. These amendments were introduced in response to legal complaints, which saw the first order blocked by US federal courts. Judges ruled that the ban was unconstitutional amid concerns it unfairly targeted Muslims, something the government denied. Hawaii was among a number of states who filed lawsuits against the original ban saying it would harm residents, businesses and schools. It filed a fresh complaint late on Wednesday, calling for an emergency block on the new order. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect. President Trump has not yet commented on Hawaii's latest legal bid, but has previously insisted he has the right to enact such an executive order and hit out at \"so political\" courts. Speaking to local news channel Khon 2, Mr Chin said the new ban had the same \"nation-of-origin discrimination problems\" as the first. He said this was a particularly sensitive issue in Hawaii because of memories of Japanese internment camps on the Pacific island during World War Two. Although the new directive sought to answer legal complaints, Mr Chin said it still constituted a \"Muslim ban\" because of the countries involved and statements from administration officials. In justifying the ban on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said there are more than 300 refugees under investigation for potential terror offences. But no further details were given. The US appeals court previously criticised the government for failing to provide \"evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order\" had committed a terrorist attack in the US.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Eleven care workers are to be sentenced later for the maltreatment and neglect of five patients at Winterbourne View. But a BBC Inside Out West investigation has found evidence of alleged abuse involving different staff members. Police have agreed the assault on Ben Pullar was \"not acceptable\" but said they would not re-open the case. Mr Pullar is autistic and bi-polar, with severe learning difficulties, and when he was 18, he spent almost a year at Winterbourne View from July 2009. He lost two teeth when he was punched in the face. His twin, Tom, said his behaviour changed drastically after going to the hospital. \"He's burst out crying on me and demanded to talk about Winterbourne View - and this is two years after Winterbourne View - so it still affects him today,\" said the 21-year-old. The BBC has seen daily care notes from his time at the hospital which state Mr Pullar \"had an accident with his teeth\" just weeks after he arrived. His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had \"bitten the floor\". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: \"I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. \"He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. \"[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch or a blow to the front of the face.\" The authorities met several days after Mr Pullar was assaulted, but his family was not invited. Tom Pullar said: \"I think that care staff are supposed to care for patients, not punch them.\" Notes obtained by Inside Out said the nurse was bitten and retaliated in order to remove his fingers - and later, that he had pushed and pulled to get them out. The nurse involved, Maxwell Nyamukapa, was suspended and later reinstated. Despite repeated attempts to contact Mr Nyamukapa, he has refused to comment. The police logged it as an assault, and said the nurse had acted instinctively and in self-defence. Forty concerns were raised about patients in just over three years with the local safeguarding board run by South Gloucestershire Council. The police were also contacted 29 times, nine of those times related to carers suspected of using restraint of involved in violent incidents with patients - including Mr Pullar. Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: \"We have carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at Winterbourne View and no stone has been left unturned. \"We consulted with the CPS and our partners in terms of action we could take. \"Looking back on that incident now and understanding the whole pattern of what was happening at that residential hospital, it is clearly not acceptable. \"However, at the time, the officer was dealing with information, reliable information, that came from patients and carers, and that came from other experts in that field. And perhaps they relied upon that information too much.\" She added: \"We accept that there is learning for us as an organisation and we will do things differently in future.\" Det Ch Supt Rolfe said the force had carried out an extensive investigation into incidents at the hospital and had improved how it dealt with people with learning disabilities. The council has declined to comment on Mr Pullar's case. Castlebeck, the hospital's owner at the time, said its new board and management had already, and would continue to, rigorously review what happened at Winterbourne View. The firm said if any other matters come to light, immediate action would be taken and the appropriate authorities informed. It has also referred Mr Nyamukapa twice to the Nursing & Midwifery Council, who declined to comment. Inside Out West is on BBC One West at 7.30pm on Monday or for seven days after on the iPlayer.",

    "source": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory. Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.",

    "source": "In a statement, the company said the move will hit next year's profit by about \u00a315m. In addition, if the pound averages $1.20 over the financial year, it may lose another \u00a320m. Overnight on Friday the pound temporarily plunged by 6%, in a flash crash that is thought to have been triggered by automated trading. Shares in Sports Direct closed down 9% on Friday. The company had expected to report underlying profit of \u00a3300m based on the pound trading at $1.30 against the dollar. However, the retailer said that \"extreme movements overnight\" would result \"in a negative impact of approximately \u00a315m\" on its results for the current financial year. The swings overnight hit the company's hedging arrangements, which are designed to protect a business against volatile currency prices. It also sustained a large loss in its last financial year because of currency movements. In that case, because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, it took a \u00a365m hit. As a result, Sports Direct reported underlying earnings of \u00a3381.4m for the year to 24 April against expectations of \u00a3420m, resulting in staff missing out on a bonus. It has been a tumultuous year for Sports Direct which has been criticised for working conditions at its Shirebrook distribution centre. Most recently, its chief executive Dave Forsey stepped down and was replaced by Mike Ashley, the founder and majority shareholder of the retail chain. The company has an acting finance director after its former financial chief Bob Mellors stepped down in December 2013 after a decade with the business. Matt Pearson was appointed as interim chief financial officer on 2 June 2015.",

But it was removed from the lot after protests by Haringey Council. It is now up for auction in June in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group. A local councillor and the local Trades Union Congress have attacked the sale. The mural, which depicts a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the side of a Poundland store last May, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. A spokesman for the auctioneers Sincura said the mural \"has been sensitively restored under a cloak of secrecy\", and will go on show alongside pieces by Damien Hirst, Andy Warhol, Mario Testino and Russell Young. But Wood Green councillor Alan Strickland said: \"This is a piece of art given to the community for public enjoyment, and people will find it galling that you can only view this work at an expensive champagne reception, when it belongs with the people of north London, not a private owner. \"We saw the level of public anger last time, as the story went around the world, and I expect the same this time.\" And Keith Flett, secretary of the Haringey Trades Union Congress, said: \"The Slave Labour Banksy belongs to the people of Haringey not to a wealthy private client.\" When the mural was up for auction in Miami, it was expected to fetch up to \u00c2\u00a3450,000. There was suspicion it had been stolen when it disappeared but the Metropolitan Police said there were \"no reports of any theft\". Slave Labour will go on sale at the London Film Museum on 2 June.",

    "source": "The employers offered no rise for last year and a rise of 1% for 2016-17. The unions say salaries for teachers in NI are falling behind their counterparts in England and Wales. The education minister said the rejection of the offer was \"disappointing.\" Peter Weir added that while he \"greatly values\" the \"hard work teachers do\" the package offered was a \"realistic one\". \"It still allows teaching staff to progress along the pay scale, in addition to a cost of living increase,\" he said. \"That offer was rejected outright by the unions as were, I understand, earlier and higher offers. \"Given the speed by which the teaching union's statements have issued, I assume they had predetermined their response prior to the negotiations concluding.\" The Northern Ireland Teachers' Council (NITC) - the body that represents all five teachers' unions, ATL, INTO, NAHT, NASUWT and UTU  - made it clear it was not ruling out industrial action. In a statement it said teachers would be \"extremely unhappy about this failure of then management side to make a reasonable offer\". It said it would \"not be surprising if they call on their leaders to take action in the coming months in order to protect not only teachers themselves but also to protect the fabric of the education service from further damage. \"This offer is an insult to teachers. It means teachers have slipped even further back in terms of their salaries,\" said Avril Hall-Callaghan, Chair of the NITC. Gerry Murphy, of INTO, added: \"The Department of Education and the employers clearly believe their offer if accepted - which would see experienced teachers' receive a salary increase of less than a pound a day - constitutes an adequate reward for all their hard work and commitment. \"They are so out of touch with the realities of life at the chalk face it is frightening.\" Mark Langhammer of ATL said: \"Increases in national insurance and pension contributions mean that many teachers' take home pay has decreased in absolute terms. \"In real terms, teachers' pay has plummeted by 15% since 2010/11. Whilst top-executive pay has rocketed stratospherically and tax is routinely avoided and evaded in the corporate world and by the super-wealthy, teachers' status in society has fallen.\" From next week, NASUWT  members will refuse to attend meetings outside school. Its General Secretary, Chris Keates, said the patience of its members had been \"exhausted\". \"Teachers in Northern Ireland are as dedicated, hardworking and committed as their colleagues in Scotland, England and Wales, and yet the employers in Northern Ireland have failed to offer them for 2015-16 even the 1% allowed under the Treasury's pay cap, which other teachers have received. \"They are now two years behind their colleagues [elsewhere in the UK] in terms of a pay settlement,\" he added.",

    "source": "On Saturday, sirens sounded for a third consecutive day warning of an incoming rocket fired from Gaza. People spending the Jewish Sabbath by the beach were sent rushing for cover. The Israeli military used its Iron Dome defence system to intercept and destroy the missile. A fifth battery had been added to it, just outside the city, only hours earlier. After the explosion, close to the coast, a small black cloud was left hanging in the sky over the sea. Tel Aviv is Israel's largest city and commercial centre but it is also a popular place to relax or party. However, despite the sunshine, outdoor restaurants, parks and pavements were much quieter over the weekend. It has taken a psychological adjustment for locals to realise that they too are now within the firing range of certain Palestinian rockets - believed to be the Iranian-made Fajr-5, which can reach up to 75km (45 miles). \"For Tel Aviv people this is a bit of a shock. The rockets hit all the time in the north and south of Israel but in Tel Aviv this never happens. I've lived here for ten years,\" said a jogger, Tzipi. Soli, who was carrying his little daughter, remarked: \"Everyone is talking about it. You can see the streets are emptier than usual and this is from just a few missiles.\" But he said there was broad support for the continuing military offensive in the Gaza Strip. \"I'm not happy with the situation where we are bombing Gaza but I think we have to do it, we have to defend ourselves,\" he said. A retired man, Amos, agreed that Palestinian militants posed a real threat. \"We have to finish this problem. This is the language they understand, not the language of peace,\" he said. Asked about the government decision to authorise the call-up of up to 75,000 military reservists, he gave his strong approval. \"We have the force. We need to have it,\" he said. \"I'm sorry about it but this is our life, our destiny.\" With Israeli troops continuing to head towards the Gaza border and speculation about a possible ground invasion, this is a difficult time for families with members serving in the military. \"I'm very worried because my son is doing his national service. He will go south,\" one man said as his wife's eyes filled with tears. \"This is what happens, I cry every time I think of my son,\" she added. The Israeli military, which has its vast headquarters in Tel Aviv, told the BBC that its offensive was putting Hamas, which governs Gaza, \"under great pressure\". However, spokeswoman Avital Leibovich confirmed that incursions still remained a possibility. \"We are getting ready for an option of ground operation. It's not decided yet but it's an option we're considering at this point,\" she said. \"Some troops were asked to approach specific areas surrounding the Gaza Strip. Some are already there, some are on their way.\" In the southern part of Tel Aviv, journalists were shown around the emergency control room for the municipality, located in an underground shelter. It is set up like a military command centre with maps on the walls and a long table positioned in front of projector screens and televisions. It would act as a back-up for city hall if the security situation demanded it. The mayor, Ron Huldai, said that residents had already adjusted well to the changed safety information and the use of sirens. \"People in the city of Tel Aviv know how to behave,\" he said. \"The solution is to find your way to the safest place in your area and there are instructions in the newspaper with the rules you have to follow. \"They're taking this seriously but not changing their routine. We are prepared.\"",

Mr Tillerson, former head of Exxon Mobil with no previous political experience, said in an interview he was \"stunned\" with the invitation. \"I didn't want this job. I didn't seek this job,\" he told the conservative website Independent Journal Review (IJR) during his recent visit to Asia. \"My wife told me I'm supposed to do this.\" In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Tillerson said he had been due to retire this month after spending more than 40 years at oil giant Exxon Mobil. He turns 65 on Thursday. \"I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids,\" he added in the interview, as he returned to the US from Beijing. Mr Tillerson said he had never met Donald Trump before his election in November. When he was invited for a conversation with the then president-elect, he thought they would talk \"about the world\" given his experiences at the oil company, he added. \"When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned.\" Mr Tillerson then gave the news to his wife, Renda St Clair, who said: \"I told you God's not through with you.\" He added: \"My wife convinced me. She was right. I'm supposed to do this.\" It was Mr Tillerson's first interview since he took office and correspondents say he has so far kept a low profile at the state department. He came under criticism after the state department press corps was not taken along with him on his trip to Asia. The IJR's Erin McPike was the only reporter allowed to travel with him. The state department said this was because of the size of the plane. But in the interview Mr Tillerson said: \"I'm not a big media press access person. I personally don't need it. \"I understand it's important to get the message of what we're doing out, but I also think there's only a purpose in getting the message out when there's something to be done.\" Mr Tillerson has also been criticised for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But when the subject came up in the interview, the IJR said: \"He was so cagey when Russia came up, for example, that his answer wasn't even worthy of inclusion.\"",

He goes back to the Nou Camp in the Champions League next week knowing the task facing his City side is immense. \"Barcelona are special in the way they play. They're a machine,\" he said. With former Barcelona officials Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain as chief executive and director of football respectively, and Guardiola as manager, there is clear influence from the Catalan giants at City. But Guardiola knows it is going to take time to achieve the identity Barcelona have forged over the past half a century. \"For the last decade, the last 50 years, Barcelona dominate football matches. I love the way they play,\" he added. \"They have three amazing players - Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar - up front. They are amazing on the counter-attack. They have a good build-up. They are a good team.\" Guardiola accepts City may have a confidence problem facing Barca, given Saturday's 1-1 draw against Everton in the Premier League means they have gone three games without a win. Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero both had penalties saved by Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, meaning Aguero has failed five times from the spot so far this season, including two for Argentina.

He said: \"They are the best team I have played against in my managerial career. \"If you look to the football, to the offensive style, the movement, the quality of the players in midfield and in front, then they are the best team in the Premier League. \"Maybe we didn't deserve a point on chances but football is unpredictable and our goalkeeper maybe played his best game ever.\"",

In the footage, which has been widely shared on social media, the policeman headbutts, slaps and kicks the driver as they quarrel beside the lorry. The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown \"severe and unusual behaviour\" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. \"It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,\" he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. \"There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,\" he said.",

Brown Rudnick also claimed it could help Cerberus \"position itself effectively with key stakeholders\". Cerberus chief operating officer Mark Neporent said Brown Rudnick claimed that they could get access to the executive via the Belfast law firm Tughans. \"They told us they could get us access to other stakeholders... the Northern Ireland Executive, people in the Republic,\" he said. Mr Neporent is giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in Dublin. Cerberus agreed to hire Brown Rudnick on 24 March 2014 and on 25 March the Cerberus chairman Dan Quayle met First Minister Peter Robinson at Stormont. Mr Neporent agreed with committee member Mary Lou McDonald that Brown Rudnick \"were as good as their word\"  in getting access. Nama, an Irish state agency, was established in 2009 to take control of billions of euro of bad property loans which were damaging the Irish banks. Controversy has surrounded the sales process. Brown Rudnick and Tughans had previously been working with another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio. Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor. Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms \"a success fee only basis\", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done. Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans. Cerberus said it received \"express confirmation\" from both firms that no fee or commission was payable to any current or former Nama advisors.",

Mayor Aime Navello told the Associated Press he married them at the town hall. The short service was followed by a reception for family and friends, reported to have included Righton's bandmates and actress Sienna Miller. Knightley, 28, announced her engagement to Righton, 29, last year. \"Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James,\" Mr Navello told the Daily Mail. \"I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them.\" The actress, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in 2005's Pride and Prejudice, is the daughter of playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley. She rose to fame in the British hit Bend it like Beckham, becoming an international star in films including Love Actually and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 'More interesting' Knightley also won critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Atonement, A Dangerous Method and, most recently, Anna Karenina. Later this year, she will be seen in Jack Ryan - a prequel to previous Tom Clancy adaptations - playing Cathy Ryan opposite Chris Pine. Singer and keyboard player Righton has performed with indie rock band the Klaxons since 2005. The group won a Mercury Music Prize in 2007 for their debut album Myths Of The Near Future. In an interview last month, Knightley said she did not want an extravagant wedding day. \"We're not 'big wedding' types. I don't need to have all that. I'm just trying to enjoy the engagement bit. \"My parents are together after 40 years. The fights are there but they love each other. \"It's not like the first three months, the first two years... whatever it is, but I think it gets more interesting, or I hope so.\"",

The Republic of Ireland currently has strict abortion laws, which only allow a pregnancy to be terminated if there is a serious risk to a woman's life. The Citizens' Assembly voted 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions. Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote, but any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland. Of the votes cast, 89% were in favour of allowing abortion on grounds of rape or fatal foetal abnormality - when doctors believe an unborn child is likely to die before, during or shortly after birth. There was less support for legal terminations for \"socio-economic reasons\" but still, 72% of members who took part voted in favour of abortion in those circumstances. However, anti-abortion campaigners dismissed the results of the ballots as a \"muddled and confused farce\". Cora Sherlock of the Pro Life Campaign accused the assembly of having a \"chaotic\" and \"one-sided approach\" in how it conducted its business from the beginning. She added: \"There is nothing liberal or progressive about the assembly recommending a referendum to strip unborn babies of their right to life in law and also ignoring the negative consequences of abortion for women.\" The Citizens' Assembly is chaired by the Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who will now present a report on members' recommendations to the Oireachtas by late June. In a statement, the chair said members had \"reached a conclusion of sorts\" and she thanked them for having \"engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed themselves in medical and ethical discourse, and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others\". \"I also wish to acknowledge those whose perspectives or opinions did not emerge in the final vote,\" the judge added. \"This is an exercise in deliberative democracy and their vote remains important to me because of the very fact it captures that other perspective, that dissenting voice, the different interpretation and I wish to assure them that their votes and voices will be recorded and have a place in the report.\" On receipt of her report, elected representatives will consider members' calls for a change in the law, and whether or not to hold a referendum.",

    "source": "The Times Educational Supplement (TES) says measures to guard against grade inflation were not appropriate for this year's English exams. Teaching unions have accused Ofqual of \"regulatory failure\" and say it is more evidence of flawed exam marking. But the regulator insists it applied its measures correctly. It comes as state and private school heads call for an independent inquiry into the problems. Last week Ofqual said it felt the way this year's English GCSE exams were graded was fair, despite the  grade boundaries being moved significantly part-way through the year. Teachers have complained that pupils achieving exactly the same marks would have received different grades depending on what time of year they sat the exam. And many who were predicted a grade C, obtained a grade D in their summer exams. Ofqual found that June's grade boundaries were correct, while January's were \"too lenient\". A key document sent to exam boards, which is on the Ofqual website, sets out how it expects exam boards to use a process known as \"comparable outcomes\" to ensure that grade standards are maintained between GCSEs year-on-year. It sets out five conditions for when such processes should be used to alter the way papers are marked. According to the TES report, this year's English GCSE and the circumstances around it failed to meet four of the conditions. The first of Ofqual's five conditions was that the cohort - or pupils from that year- in a subject \"must be similar, in terms of ability, to those of previous years\". But last week's report on English GCSEs noted that the \"attainment profile\" for 2012 dropped, as grammar and independent school pupils were replaced with extra, lower-achieving comprehensive pupils. The second condition was that the qualification must be \"fit for purpose\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament that this year's English GCSE was \"not fit for purpose\". The third condition was that the \"nature of the qualification\" must be the same. Ofqual's report last week stated that \"these qualifications are different from previous English qualifications in a number of ways\". Finally, the regulator said in the letter that comparable outcomes must only be applied where \"previous grades were appropriate\". Ofqual's report said that the English GCSE grades in January were \"too generous\". The only condition that appears to have been met is that teaching standards have remained largely consistent. The guidelines also state: \"Students should not be advantaged or disadvantaged simply because they were the first to sit a new set of examinations.\" The watchdog has interpreted its own conditions differently, and is insisting that the comparable outcomes approach that prevented grades from rising in June was correctly implemented. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT heads' union, said: \"Ofqual doesn't seem to have applied the concept of comparable outcomes properly. \"In this instance there is a regulatory failure. It is a big mess.\" And Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said this appeared to be \"another piece of evidence that procedures applied to this exam was not fit for purpose\". Meanwhile, Ofqual said: \"The comparable outcomes approach was used correctly for GCSE English this year and we stand by this decision. \"Comparable outcomes are not intended to produce identical results year on year. \"What's important is that outcomes can be compared when taking into consideration a range of factors which may affect the results. More details on the use of this approach can be found in our report.\" But Dr Christopher Ray, chairman of the Head Masters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said the issue was evidence of a deeper problem with Ofqual. \"The verdict of Ofqual's initial report and the reasoning to support it fall well short of answering the questions raised in the minds of schools and pupils.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"It is clear that pupils, parents and education professionals, across the spectrum of schools, feel that pupils have been done a disservice. \"Whilst the Education Secretary Michael Gove says he is 'saddened' by the injustice that has been served to thousands of pupils, he is showing how out-of-touch he is with pupil opinion by refusing to take action. Labour supports calls for an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this mess.\" The Commons Education Committee is set to start an inquiry into the GCSE grading problems next week.",

Both have denied the allegations. The charges were filed by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005, but Mr Greenberg and Mr Smith have fought them, saying they have no merit. However, the Court of Appeals said there's enough evidence for the trial to proceed. Current New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he wanted to pursue the case to show \"no one, no matter how rich or powerful, can evade responsibility for misconduct.\" Mr Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, has said he believes the lawsuit was driven by Mr Spitzer's political motivations. \"This case was brought by Eliot Spitzer expressly because he was angry at Hank Greenberg,\" Mr Boies said. The trial before Justice Charles Ramos of New York state court in Manhattan, which will take place three days a week, is expected to last for up to six months. The insurance giant almost collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis. The firm, which issued credit guarantees for sub-prime mortgages, was bailed out by the US government, which took an 80% stake in the firm and provided nearly $185bn in aid. Sub-prime loans are those given to people with patchy credit histories or who cannot prove their incomes. Mr Greenberg resigned from the firm in March 2005.",

And Houston is hoping his new charges can grab fourth place, and a play-off berth, at least. \"It's our remit that we'd love to try to get in the play-offs, that would be a huge achievement,\" said Houston. The 55-year-old, who had been working as a scout with Celtic after leaving Dundee United last year, is relishing the chance to take on Rangers, Hearts and Hibs. It's not always the big guys that win games. I've been to Hearts, Hibs and Rangers before as a manager and won. The Bairns reached the Championship play-off semi-final in season 2013-14 but were beaten by Hamilton Academical, who eventually won promotion to the Premiership. \"The better chances are going to go to one of the big three clubs in the league, however, that's on paper and football is not played on paper,\" said Houston. \"I've got to make sure that the lads I've got, when they come to face Rangers, Hearts and Hibs, there's a belief in them. \"It's a great thing for the players at Falkirk to go to Ibrox, Tynecastle, Easter Road and pit themselves against what's going to be a stronger squad. \"It's not always the big guys that win games. I've been to Hearts, Hibs and Rangers before as a manager and won.\" A former Falkirk player, Houston won the 2010 Scottish Cup as Dundee United boss. And after succeeding Gary Holt, who left the manager's position at the Falkirk Stadium to join Neil Adams' coaching team at Norwich City, Houston said returning to the Bairns was an offer he could not turn down. \"I probably wouldn't have jumped at it if it had been any other club than Falkirk, as they mean an awful lot to me, \" Houston added. \"I left here 18 years ago to go to Hearts as a youth coach and I said in the local newspaper I'd like to go and learn the game then come back as manager. I didn't think it would be as long as 18 years but I'm delighted to be back.\" Houston, who said his eight month stint at Celtic had advanced him as \"coach and a person\", revealed he is close to securing the services of  a new player-coach for Falkirk. As well as his four-year managerial spell at Tannadice, Houston was also assistant to Craig Levein when the latter was Scotland coach.

    "source": "He has sent a business case to Finance Minister M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir outlying how he intends to tackle the projected \u00a3490m overspend. The scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister. Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. The plan by the economy minister has now been formally submitted to the Department of Finance for approval. Mr Hamilton and Mr \u00d3 Muilleoir held talks on the issue last week. Analysis: BBC News NI's Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill. The BBC understands the plan involves a two-staged approach. First, it would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1,800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015. This would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer-term solution. But there remains an acceptance within the Department for the Economy that any moves on tariffs could face a legal challenge. It is understood that a significant number of RHI recipients have told the Department for the Economy they do not wish their names made public. The department had written to them asking for views on their names being released. Mrs Foster and Mr Hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited. It is believed the department is taking legal advice on its options. The failure of the political parties to find a resolution on how to investigate the failings in the scheme has led to a political crisis at Stormont. Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses her first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness. The Sinn F\u00e9in MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election. The party has seven days to nominate a new deputy first minister, but is adamant it will not replace him. If it chooses not to, then the baton would pass to Secretary of State James Brokenshire who would be legally obliged to call an election. In an effort to avert such a move, the British and Irish governments have pledged to do what they can to resolve the crisis.",

    "source": "Trinity led 16-10 at the break after tries from former Cas centre Joe Arundel (2) and stand-off Jacob Miller. Cas had mustered two first-half scores by Greg Minikin and Oliver Holmes. But they added six more after the break through Andre Savelio, Luke Gale, who also kicked seven goals, Junior Moors, Ryan Hampshire, Minikin and Holmes. It was a debut try for forward Savelio, who only joined the Tigers on loan from St Helens on Wednesday, but Cas lost Rangi Chase with a back problem while Super League's leading try scorer winger Denny Solomona pulled out with food poisoning.. Wakefield, who lost centre Bill Tupou, second rower Jonny Molloy and loose forward Mickey Sio with injuries, managed just one score in the second half, from winger Reece Lyne, while Liam Finn failied to add to his two first-half kicks. The Tigers' storming finish, in which they scored five tries in 22 minutes, secured a fourth successive derby win to climb a place into sixth above Wakefield. Trinity drop to eighth thanks to Widnes beating fifth-placed Catalans, although they were all already guaranteed a top-eight finish ahead of the Super 8s split. But for Salford's six-point deduction, the injury-hit Wildcats would have ended up in the Qualifiers. Instead, they can now turn their attention to next Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington at Leigh Sports Village  - and their bid to reach a first Wembley final for 37 years. Wakefield coach Chris Chester:. \"We had one guy fit on the bench for the last 35 minutes and that really hurt us. We had a front-rower (David Fifita) who played 65 minutes in the middle which was a great achievement. \"It was a good even contest for 50 minutes then we get a penalty, miss touch and we give a penalty away and concede. It took it away from us. \"I'm not overly disappointed because there was bags of effort out there but we just ran out of troops, and Castleford were too good for us. \"Bill came off with a hamstring injury, Jonny Molloy has got a pectoral issue and Mickey Sio got a sternum injury so those three couldn't come back.\" Castleford coach Daryl Powell:. \"It's been an incredible effort for us over 23 rounds. 14 players couldn't play today. It's been really tough. \"So for us to end up finishing sixth is an awesome achievement. I'm really proud of the players. We'll reap the rewards in the long run from what's happened this year.\" \"We were a bit helter-skelter at times but it was really pleasing how we grabbed the game in the second half. \"Savelio did really well. He's trained with us a couple of times and he handled himself really well. He's a good player. I've always rated him - and he fitted into our team really well.\" Wakefield: Jowitt; Lyne, B Tupou, Arundel, Hall; Miller, Finn; Scruton, Sio, Fifita, Walton, Ashurst, Molloy.

She then used her position as treasurer at the boys club to pay cheques into its account before taking the cash. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Stewart, 48, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was also told to repay \u00a327,000. The court previously heard that Stewart worked in the accounts department of Ivanhoe Cambridge UK, which sold the St Enoch Centre in 2013. Between May 2008 and January 2011 she had managers at the firm sign cheques that were supposed to be used to make legitimate payments. Stewart would then write over the payee name and insert the football team's name. The money would go to the club before Stewart took it for herself. She was caught after a bank spotted a problem with one of the cheques from Ivanhoe Cambridge and phoned her office. Stewart then immediately confessed to her superiors and a payment plan was put in place for her to repay the money. The court heard that although more than \u00a35,000 was repaid, the plan was not completed and her house was put on the market. The house was rendered worthless due to Japanese Knotweed, and Stewart was later reported to police. Stewart appeared for sentencing on Thursday having earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzling the money. The court heard that Stewart's husband had been jailed in 2003 for three-and-a-half years for drug dealing and she had resorted to theft to repay the debts that he wracked up. Imposing a community payback order, Sheriff Linda Ruxton told Stewart that her embezzlement was \"deliberate and systematic\" but she accepted the \"impact on her of her husband's criminal behaviour\".

Sussex Police said his death was not suspicious, and the coroner ruled it was \"accidental\". Nick Cave, 58, is an Australian songwriter and is best known as lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Mr Cave and his wife Susie Bick are at the hearing which is being held in front of Brighton senior coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley at Woodvale Crematorium. The inquest heard Arthur had taken LSD with a friend and he was seen \"staggering\" on his own before he fell off the cliff. Members of the public tried to resuscitate him after he was found lying on the ground without any shoes or socks on. During evidence given by pathologist Dr Simi George, Ms Hamilton-Deeley asked: \"The history you had was that LSD was used?\" Dr George replied: \"Yes.\" The cause of death was given as \"multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height\". Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Ms Hamilton-Deeley, said: \"I expect the decision and planning to take LSD, or a hallucinogenic drug likely to be LSD, was made on the spur of the moment. \"It's clear he could not know what was real and what was not real. \"It's completely impossible to know what was in Arthur's mind and what he was seeing.\" In a statement issued after the inquest, the Cave family said they had been \"overwhelmed\" by the messages of support from people \"in Brighton and beyond\". It read: \"Arthur was a wonderfully unruly, creative and free-spirited young man with an infectious, happy, funny daredevil nature. \"He loved his friends and family, idolised his twin brother Earl and was never far from his side.\"",

    "source": "On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at North Middlesex University Hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the London hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in April and May. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the A&E department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other London trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief Inspector of Hospitals Sir Mike Richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and I note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to A and E which is so badly needed. \"There is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"The important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added. Tottenham MP David Lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than I feared\" and demanded answers from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: \"It shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the Health Secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement. The trust is now required to improve the care of patients in the emergency department by 26 August 2016 following a warning from the CQC. A full inspection of the trust will take place in September.",

He the closures would deliver better value for money and release enough land across the UK to build 55,000 homes. It is also estimated that about \u00c2\u00a3140m will be saved over the next decade by selling off the sites, which Sir Michael said would be reinvested in creating \"areas of military expertise\" in locations across the country, including a specialised infantry group in Aldershot. Leader of Gosport Borough Council, Mark Hook, said: \"We are relieved the majority of jobs will remain in the area, but we'll lose the economic benefits of having more than 1,000 sailors based in the town.\" He admitted the authority could not stop the sale of the land, but said it would work to get the \"best possible outcomes\" for the town. He said it would be \"seeking assurances\" from the MoD that the sites could be redeveloped for business use. \"We need to reduce the impact on the area by using these sites to create business spaces that will bring with them opportunities and jobs to benefit local people,\" he said.

    "source": "Ayla Ellison, of Ulverston, Cumbria, suffered severe brain damage following a \"traumatic\" birth at Furness General Hospital, Barrow, in April 2007. In 2012, Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust admitted staff negligence. At London's High Court earlier it was ruled the trust will pay a tax-free sum every year for the rest of Ayla's life. Mr Justice Warby ruled the organisation must pay an index-linked amount starting at \u00a3225,000 and rising to \u00a3290,000 when she turns 18. While admitting it was at fault, the trust had disputed the value of the claim for damages. It has been providing financial assistance to the family since 2012. Ayla, now eight, is totally immobile and dependent on being fed through a tube. The court was told she is at constant risk of hypothermia as she cannot control her body temperature. Despite her immobility, she suffers muscle spasms that leave her \"screaming inconsolably at the top of her voice for hours\". Painkillers do not stop the pain, which can only be quelled by immersion in a hydrotherapy pool. Ayla's father now works in London and the settlement includes \u00a31.6m to buy a family home in Richmond. Further money will be needed to adapt it to Ayla's needs and install a hydrotherapy pool. The judge awarded a \u00a3295,000 lump sum for Ayla's pain, suffering and disability and he paid tribute to her parents for the \"calm and intelligent way\" they had dealt with the tragedy. Trust medical director David Walker said: \"We are very sorry for the harm caused to Ayla and the distress caused to her family as a result of the issues arising from her birth. \"The injuries she suffered are very severe and a tragedy for her and her family. Her parents have had to cope with extraordinary pressures in looking after her.\"",

Harry Potter creator Rowling has planned scripts for a total of five films in the series. The first instalment is set in New York, and tells the story of a fictional author mentioned in the Potter stories. Redmayne plays the part of the animal-loving magizoologist Newt Scamander, who visits New York's secret community of witches and wizards. The film is set 70 years before Harry Potter reads his book at his school, Hogwarts. It has received broadly positive reviews from critics. The opening weekend haul in the US and Canada was lower than for any of the Harry Potter films, however.

    "source": "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples:. Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.",

    "source": "Bailly is due to have a medical this week and terms are thought to have been agreed with the 22-year-old, who will cost the Red Devils about \u00a330m. He has played 40 times in La Liga, the first five of which were for Espanyol. Bailly joined Villarreal for \u00a34.4m in January 2015 and played in every game as Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations just weeks later. It had been thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be Mourinho's first signing since the Portuguese succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager. The Sweden striker, 34, is a free agent after leaving Paris St-Germain and hinted at the weekend he would make an announcement about his future on Tuesday. But he has refused to elaborate, saying: \"There is no confirmation. Keep wondering. I am enjoying the stories.\" Bailly's reputation has soared this season, which saw him play a key role as Villarreal sealed Champions League qualification, and it's no surprise to see him make a big-money move this summer. His prime asset is his extremely impressive physical presence, with his powerful aerial ability complimenting his pace and strength in the tackle. The brave and determined 22-year-old has less than 50 league games under his belt, though, so United fans should perhaps not expect him to immediately become an automatic starter. He can sometimes concede possession in dangerous areas by making bad decisions, and he doesn't always show composure under pressure, but Bailly possesses all the physical tools and the rest should come with more experience.

    "source": "Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic. Does this mean the war on drugs has been lost? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer. After many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney. \"About 10 years into my career, it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\" One Colombian drug runner had a big impact:. \"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else.  So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks. \"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\" She noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:. \"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia.  We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place. \"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\" She argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:. \"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it. \"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'. \"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\" Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs. \"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did. \"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that. \"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis. \"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\" He cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade. \"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands. \"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place. \"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\" Former chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:. \"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves. \"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets. \"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency. \"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished. \"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground. \"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\" Professor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades. \"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric. \"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself. \"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future. \"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome. \"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\" As drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:. \"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state. \"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions. \"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising. \"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence. \"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it. And we may manage it better or worse, but the notion that we solve a problem is simplistic. We're simply managing a problem.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.",

And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. \"I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,\" joked Wright, 53. \"I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. \"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\" As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. \"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. \"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. \"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\" Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  \"having good people and a good squad\". On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.",

    "source": "In that time, the technology developed here has changed India immensely. Mr Modi is here to make sure it continues to do so for decades to come, but perhaps now with more benefit to those back home. His visit, which was welcomed by more than 20,000 expats on Sunday evening at a stadium reception in San Jose, comes at a time when Indian and Indian-American success in Silicon Valley is truly formidable. There's the charismatic Satya Nadella in charge at Microsoft. There's the 10-year-strong reign of Shantanu Narayen at the top of Adobe. And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it's the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success their way. \"If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley-based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me, \"I'm going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think-tank study suggests 87% of Indians have \"favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on \"Team Modi\" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi's visit, backed up this concern. They believe the positivity around his leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards its critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. \"We're very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. Some 26% of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. That's more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, he needs help. Before India can even begin to think of itself as a genuinely major technology player, it needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley's obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and \"i-ways\", by which he meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q&A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40,000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. They covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of his delight at his tweets and messages to other world leaders \"going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi's relationship with his mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as he told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told me it made her feel like he was \"just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build his reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook's user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said he hoped Mr Zuckerberg's motivations weren't purely about Facebook's bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. He wants India to graduate from being home to the low-end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, he wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California. One parent outside the SAP Center, whose children were dressed in stunning, sparkling saris, said she believed when her girls grow up they will see moving back to India as a career aspiration - in the same way she saw the US as way to a better life.

    "source": "The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: \"There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made.\" \"We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists.\" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared \"they would become 700 time bombs when they return\", referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer. A Belgian man, believed to be an employee of the museum, was critically injured.",

    "source": "Writing on Facebook, Vine said he too had been attacked as a 15-year-old. He encouraged the boy not to try to be tough like his attackers, saying there was \"no shame\" in reading poetry and listening to \"our favourite bands\". \"Dear Romford 15-year-old, who I'll call Ben. I don't know your name, and it's good that I don't, because I am sure you do not want to be associated with that video of the bullies savagely punching you to the ground. Bullies? They are worse than that. I was really shocked by what I saw. Loads of people were disgusted. You are just 15. Ben, something similar happened to me. I was a sensitive young teen, always trying and failing to be cool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 never athletic enough, never hip enough, a late developer, crazy hair, with uncool parents who thought church was the main event. I worshipped indie bands - Joy Division especially - in the way that sensitive souls do. I wanted to be a jock, but I was a nerd. Maybe you recognise that. One day I was at a party and spoke to a girl. Apparently she was the girlfriend of someone important. He sent his friend to beat me up. The friend said: \"Excuse me, can I tell you something?\" And because he was shorter than me I had to lean down to hear him. Having moved my head within range, he punched me as hard as you got punched. I had never been hit before. The shock was unbelievable - violence does that. I went down immediately just like you. My mates, also sensitive souls, were too scared to help. They were gutted afterwards. You feel humiliated. Your pride is hurt, your head is hurt - I had a gigantic black eye. A person can get very down over a beating. Some people think depression evolved in us as a way of keeping us safe if we lose a fight - the mind and body working together to prevent you re-entering the conflict for your own safety. It took me ages before I wasn't scared of being hit again. You look over your shoulder for a while, and you feel a primal fear. That is natural, Ben. So I watched your video and saw myself. That guy who distracted me in 1980 could be the thug who hit you from behind in 2016 - such a coward. Can I give you some advice? Don't think you have to be hard like them. I tried to be a tough teenager afterwards and closed myself off like a drum. I reacted to nothing and felt nothing. Then I got to university and found people like me who would never dream of punching someone, and my life opened up like a flower. A kind lecturer was shocked when I proudly and foolishly told him I had never read a poem. He said, \"We'll change that,\" and helped me understand the power of poetry. One day in my student room I read a poem and cried. I was alive again. Sure, I would never win a fight - I have never hit anyone in my life - but you don't need to hit people to succeed in your life. Quite the opposite. The courts will decide who assaulted you and how to punish them. In our society, what happened to you is thankfully now taken very seriously. But let me tell you something about the lads in the video. In 20 years, when you're with the person you love and hopefully in a career you have a passion for, they will still be scumbags. Their cupboards will smell of gym sweat and cheeseburgers. Each will own one suit which he wore to the funeral of a friend who died doing a wheelie on a motorway - by the way, they all wore the same baffled expression at the funeral service. They've gone from making the weather to being rained on, and they complain about it constantly. They are not something anyone wants to be with - their lives are already over. Five per cent of people are good at fighting. I'm not one and nor are you. It is very important we let the 5% fight each other. Live by the sword, die by the sword: the thug who beat me up was in hospital himself a year later after someone broke a bottle across his face. Meanwhile, you and I can read poetry and listen to our favourite bands, and if we sometimes cry, there is no shame in that. To cry is to live. The people who attacked you are the walking dead. Come into Radio 2 sometime and I'd be happy to show you around. Yours, Jeremy\"",

    "source": "Under US law, 40% of the corn harvest must be used to make biofuel, a quota which the UN says could contribute to a food crisis around the world. A drought and heatwave across the US has destroyed much of the country's corn crop, driving up prices. The US argues that producing much of its own fuel, rather than importing it, is good for the country. The latest forecasts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that this year's corn yield - the amount produced per acre - will be the lowest since 1995-6. Total production will be the lowest for six years, it forecast, due to the extreme heat and dryness. As a result, the USDA is predicting further rises in prices. It now thinks farm prices for corn will average $7.50-$8.90 per bushel, a sharp rise on the $5.40-$6.40 per bushel it predicted just a month ago. By Mark MardellNorth America editor. Writing in the Financial Times, the director general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva, said suspension of the quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply. \"The situation reminds us that even the most advanced agricultural systems are subject to the vagaries of the weather, leading to volatility in supplies and prices, not just on domestic markets, but also internationally.\" Concerns about the impact of the dry weather in the US pushed maize prices up by 23% in July, according to the latest FAO food price index. But the US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the biofuels standard was having a positive impact on the country. \"It is impacting in a positive way the cost of gasoline in this country - some estimates put it at 25 cents to as much as $1.30 less for gas because we have a biofuel industry. \"There are jobs connected to that industry and less reliance on foreign oil. The question is: Is the market responding to concerns about supply and the answer is yes. \"Exports are down just a bit and ethanol production is down from between 10% and 30%, depending on the part of the country.\" By law, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must be produced in the US this year. The country's Renewable Fuel Standard, as the law is known, was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on imported oil. It has long been controversial, with many blaming the quota for pushing up corn prices. The United Nations is not alone in calling for the quota to be suspended. Livestock producers in the US, worried about the cost of cattle feed, also want it scrapped and the governments of China, India and France have expressed concerns about the policy.",

But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback. It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition. The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous. The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net. After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser. Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming. Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations. The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway's triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships. Media playback is not supported on this device. The match had to be rescheduled for 11:00 BST on Sunday after torrential rain fell on Saturday night in Rotterdam.

England's Chris Wood (66) was fourth on 13 under, one shot clear of Italy's Francesco Molinari (74), who was tied for the lead with An overnight. The 23-year-old An's win is his first on one of the world's major tours. An was the youngest-ever winner of the US Amateur Championship in 2009, at the age of 17. Media playback is not supported on this device. He became only the third European Tour rookie to win the prestigious PGA Championship in its 60-year history and his 267 total over four rounds also beat the tournament record by two shots. His victory, the first time the European Tour's flagship event has been won by an Asian, will see him climb into the world's top 60, secured his place in the US Open and Open Championship and a five-year exemption in Europe. \"It's going to be life changing,\" said An, the son of two Olympic table-tennis medallists - his mother Jiao Zhimin represented China and his father Ahn Jae Hyung competed for South Korea. \"This is the biggest event on the European Tour and there are a lot of benefits. I played really well today and had all the confidence going into the last couple of holes.\" An began the final round tied for the lead with Molinari and, despite picking up shots at the second and fourth, was only one ahead at the turn thanks to a hat-trick of birdies from Jaidee from the fifth. However, a birdie at the 11th and tap-in eagle at the 12th gave An a three-shot cushion that became four when Jaidee bogeyed the 13th. An made certain of victory with birdies on the 15th and 17th and a par on the last completed a hugely impressive performance from the Challenge Tour graduate. Bristol's Wood had a hole in one at the 14th, winning himself a car from the sponsors in the process.",

    "source": "With a fifth successive title win all but wrapped up, the PFA Scotland Player of the Year says thoughts are now turning to defending the crown next season. \"We're fired up again for next year,\" Griffiths said. \"We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six.\" Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign. \"As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special,\" said the Celtic striker. \"I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it.\" Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading. Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support. Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign. \"We were disappointing,\" admits Griffiths. \"The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.\" \"{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing.\" The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer. Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic. \"Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,\" said the Scotland international. \"There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad. \"I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan.\" The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season. So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland. \"As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us. \"Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.\" Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend. \"The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday. \"We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us.\" Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team. The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order. Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September. \"I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn. \"We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man.\"",

Luton Crown Court heard Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, said he was unable to see at the point of impact. He denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said Mrs Blackburn, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils were leaving school on the last day of term. She was wearing a long-sleeved high-visibility orange and yellow coat which had reflective strips and \"school crossing patrol\" written on the back. When the traffic lights turned red, she stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road. Traffic travelling in the opposite direction stopped, but Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop and hit her at 14mph, the jury heard. Witnesses described Mrs Blackburn's head hitting the screen pillar of the windscreen before she struck the wing mirror and then the road. The married mother of three was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was later transferred to Bedford Hospital and is now at a residential care home for people with an acquired brain injury. Mr Wright, of The Dell, declined to comment in police interview but in a statement said he was blinded by the setting sun and lowered his visor but was unable to see when the collision happened. The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright's eyes. Ms Mealing-McLeod told the jury that if his vision had been affected he should have stopped.

In a majority of cases there was also no evidence that victims' views were taken into account on key decisions. The CPS said its own data showed a \"markedly different\" picture to the \"small sample\" used in the report. Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate's communicating with victims report looked at the speed and quality of the CPS's communication with victims of crime. As part of its investigation, inspectors visited six of the 13 CPS areas in England and Wales, during a three-week period. They examined 162 case and complaint files and interviewed CPS staff, police and crime commissioners and partner organisations such as Citizens Advice. The Inspectorate said the CPS should be more consistent in the quality of their letters and how quickly they send them to victims, and added the CPS and police should agree on their roles in communicating case outcomes to victims to avoid sending confusing or duplicated information. They also stated the CPS should \"implement an effective process\" for notifying victim liaison units when charges are altered in a case, so that staff can inform victims. Inspectors did say the CPS was facing increased pressure due to staff cuts, and the report also highlighted that the organisation had taken steps to improve service, including drafting new guidance about speaking to witnesses at court to improve the quality of service. But the CPS criticised the small sample used in the report and said their own figures showed they had improved service. Chief crown prosecutor Martin Goldman said the CPS is \"committed to delivering a high quality service to victims and witnesses and supporting them throughout their case\". He said: \"Last year a survey showed that two-thirds of victims and three-quarters of witnesses were satisfied or very satisfied with the service they received from the CPS. \"80% of letters to victims due to reach them within one day meet the target, and this increases to 89% of letters due to reach victims within five days.\"",

    "source": "With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: \"We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. \"We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, \"proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's \"narcissistic\" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to \"trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. \"Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says \"did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency\". \"The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. \"The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: \"The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: \"I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.  According to the former adviser, only Carla Bruni ever cashed her cheque.",

The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: \"Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services. \"We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications.\" It later said no patient data or care had been affected. Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: \"It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems. \"However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online.\" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware. In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros \"if the data encoding is incorrect\". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said: \"It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. \"I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.\"",

    "source": "As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: \"He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist.\" Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a \"mass-casualty\" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet caf\u00e9 near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the \"Hi Buddy\" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: \"I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates.\" The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as \"hostile reconnaissance\". He said: \"That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographed\u2026 that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches.\" Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: \"It would have potentially been bigger than the 7/7 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets.\" The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. \"Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. \"I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester.\"",

    "source": "The proceedings in London will be \"the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination,\" he told a court. Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date. Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study. \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include:. The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent. The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London: \"We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. \"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.",
    "reference": "The public inquiry into undercover policing may \"expose both creditable and discreditable conduct\", chairman Lord Justice Pitchford has warned.",
    "prediction": "An inquiry into claims police spied on political and social justice groups in England and Wales for more than 50 years is likely to \"expose both creditable and discreditable conduct\", Lord Justice Pitchford has said.",

But the Stars showed up well in the 4-2 semi-final defeat to Cardiff Devils and the 15-8 third-place match loss to Belfast Giants. \"It's been a great experience for our guys and hopefully next year we can come back here and learn from it, like Cardiff did,\" LeFebvre said. \"I had some time to reflect on Saturday's performance against Cardiff and I'm so proud of my players. It was a dream start for us to go 2-0 up in the first period. \"It was always going to be a tough task keeping that pace up all game against a team like the Devils, who are rightfully league champions. \"But to be the first team from Dundee to make it to this weekend, it's not to be sniffed at and I'm proud of that.\" Dundee could hold their heads high after a great performance against the Devils in Saturday's semi-final, even if it was to end in a 4-2 defeat. Vinny Scarsella teed up Kevin Hart on the blue line and he fired his effort past Devils goalie Ben Bowns to open the scoring. Stars then went two up as Brett Switzer's low diagonal shot beat Bowns at his bottom right hard corner. The Devils started to claw their way back into the game six minutes into the second period as Joey Haddad found space in front of Dundee's goal to finish. The EIHL champions pulled level when Mark Louis reacted quickest to tuck in an equaliser. Devils completed the comeback with nine minutes left as Joey Martin put them 3-2 ahead before Andrew Hotham confirmed their place in Sunday's final with a late empty-net goal. It meant an early start on Sunday for the Stars who had to face fellow beaten semi-finalists Belfast Giants, who had gone down 2-0 to eventual play-off winners Sheffield Steelers. The sides shared 23 goals with Justin Faryna netting two for Dundee, while Kevin Bruijsten, Joey Sides, Mikael Lidhammar, Matt White, Vinny Scarsella and Craig Moore were also on target for Stars. LeFebvre added: \"The third place game was a lot of fun I guess, but overall, we enjoyed the experience of being involved in this weekend. \"Both us and Belfast knew what we were in for in that game on Sunday and the pace of play there would be. It picked up a little bit in the latter stages. \"It's more an exhibition game for the fans. Lots of goals, not a lot of hits and penalties and some skills. But they have to figure something out about that game. \"If the league put something on the line for them, like some extra money, it might improve it as a spectacle and guys might go harder. \"Unfortunately, two teams have to play in that game and on this occasion, it was us and Belfast. I'm sure after seeing that, the league may look at it.\" Sheffield Steelers took the silverware in an epic Sunday final, beating Cardiff Devils 6-5 after overtime in a game that lasted just under 95 minutes. Saturday. Semi-finals. Cardiff Devils 4-2 Dundee Stars. Belfast Giants 0-2 Sheffield Steelers. Sunday. Third place play-off. Belfast Giants 15-8 Dundee Stars. Final. Cardiff Devils 5 Sheffield Steelers 6 (OT)",

In a screening prior to signing for the club, an electrocardiogram test showed his heart was \"unequivocally abnormal\" but he was not stopped from playing. The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties. In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were \"relieved\" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle . \"Just as Radwan had no choice but to start his difficult journey towards recovery, we had no choice but to start the difficult journey to obtain justice,\" they said. \"We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son. \"The club did not tell us or Radwan about his potentially fatal condition. Had they done so, Radwan would not have continued to play football.\" The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain. In the 2015 hearing, Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled the club was 70% liable or Mr Hamed's injuries and Dr Peter Mills, the Football Association's regional cardiologist for South East England, was 30% liable. The Premier League club will not be hit with a fee directly as their 70% portion was incurred by physicians they previously employed, who have agreed to indemnify the club. Football Association rules require all football academy recruits to be referred to a cardiologist to help identify those prone to potentially fatal heart conditions. Mr Hamed's MRI scan showed no obvious signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Dr Mills wrote to Spurs saying the condition could not be excluded on these findings alone. Eleven months later, the teenager, who was unaware his tests had revealed an \"abnormal\" heart condition, signed a contract with Spurs. A spokesman for Spurs said: \"The club wholeheartedly regrets that a former employee, as adjudged, was remiss in their duties to Radwan. \"This judgment will hopefully now secure the best possible treatment and care for him.\"",

    "source": "Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham in Leicestershire, was found dead last November. Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, admitted raping and murdering the teenager at a hearing in April. He and Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, are on trial at Nottingham Crown Court after both denied a charge of false imprisonment. Harlow had also previously pleaded guilty to sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child. Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Kayleigh went willingly to Harlow's flat in Ibstock, Leicestershire on 13 November. She believed they were in a \"secret relationship\" after chatting on Facebook for about a fortnight, the court heard, and had told her family she was staying with her best friend. Harlow - who called himself \"Luke Fun Times Harlow\" online - told the teenager she was his \"princess\" who he would \"love and treasure forever\". \"On that night Kayleigh had been given substantial amounts of alcohol and she had been sexually touched by Luke Harlow,\" said Ms Moore. \"She was underage and he knew it.  He was later to lie about that, pretending to people that she was much older.\" Ms Moore said the false imprisonment charge centred around what happened to Kayleigh between 21:00 and 03:00 BST on 14 and 15 November. Both men are alleged to have held Kayleigh against her will. The jury heard that at one point, Kayleigh had tried to escape Harlow's flat and was seen by a witness leaving the property naked from the waist down. \"What happened to her in that property to make her flee into the night?\" Ms Moore said. \"What we know is that she was chased by Mr Beadman and pinned to the ground. This was seen by somebody from their upstairs window. \"At some point, far from being this drunken, compliant girl, Kayleigh became somebody who wanted to get out of that flat.\" Ms Moore said that the witness mistook Beadman for a policeman. Beadman then took her \"off into the night, where she was raped and murdered by him\". After Beadman had been by interviewed by police for three days and directed officers to a location on the outskirts of Ibstock. Her body was then discovered in thick undergrowth near a stream. Following examinations of Harlow's phone, police discovered he had sought to groom other girls. His intention was to kidnap them, get them drunk, have sex and keep them in his flat, the jury was told. \"Kayleigh Haywood was not the only girl Luke Harlow groomed,\" Ms Moore said. \"She was the last in the line.\" He has also admitted attempting to meet two other underage girls for sexual purposes. Police from across the East Midlands helped with the hunt for the teenager after she went missing on 13 November. A passerby found Kayleigh's smashed phone on the ground in Ibstock. The last number she had dialled was the number of the friend she said she was staying with. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries. The trial - which is expected to last until next week - continues.",

    "source": "Sale had raced to a 31-9 lead just after half-time at AJ Bell Stadium before Wasps found their groove. Tries from Josh Bassett and Ashley Johnson put them back in touching distance at 31-21 before Sale's Will Addison delivered a vital three points. Kurtley Beale scored Wasps' third try 11 minutes from time and that made for a tense finish but Sale held firm. Wasps had been unbeaten in their past six Premiership matches but looked off the pace from early on. Conversely, Sale showed quickly they wanted to make a statement and did so through rugby league covert Solomona. His move from Castleford Tigers has attracted controversy off-the-field, but on it, his hat-trick took his try tally to seven in his first five matches - a new Premiership record. Another new face, South Africa international Willie Le Roux made his Premiership debut for Wasps and the full-back set up Beale's try after coming off the bench. But as Wasps threatened in the closing stages, Sale replacement scrum-half Peter Stringer gained a vital turnover and marshalled his pack to help run down the clock. Sale remain in 10th place, but open up a 10-point gap above Worcester, who lost to Exeter this weekend. At the other end, Wasps remain top by six points, but missed the chance to go as much as 10 points clear of Saracens and Exeter in joint-second. Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond:. \"First half was particularly good. It was a training ground move for the first try. \"Denny's shown his true class a couple of times and he should have got another one really shouldn't he? \"Denny takes his opportunities and makes his opportunities and that is what we knew he'd bring to the party. If he keeps doing that, he'll go a long way. \"It's good to get us past the 25-point mark, which I always think you need to stay in league.\" Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:. \"I'm sure there will be accusations of complacency, but I don't think that was the case. \"It is very hard to argue that we weren't where we should be at mentally. We made uncharacteristic mistakes first half that we haven't done all season. \"I thought they were the better team, had more edge to them than we did and I thought they deserved their win. \"We haven't lost too many physical battles this season so you have to look at yourself really - they had an edge today that we didn't have.\" Sale: Haley; Solomona, Addison (capt), Jennings, McGuigan; James, Phillips; Harrison, Webber, Aulika, Evans, Nott, Ioane, Lund, Beaumont.

    "source": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 in April 2013. As part of the prosecution's summing up, medical examiners gave graphic details of the injuries suffered by those who died in the attack. Mr Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if found guilty. Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified that the youngest victim of the attacks, eight-year-old Martin Richard, received injuries to every part of his body. The testimony was illustrated by autopsy photos and the child's bloody, torn clothing. Mr Nields said one piece of shrapnel appeared to have gone straight through Richard's body. \"It would be difficult to say the precise location due to the size of the openings in the abdomen,\" he testified, according to Reuters. The defence began calling its own witnesses later on Monday. Earlier in the trial, the defence made the surprise admission that Mr Tsarnaev had participated in the attacks. But defence lawyers argue that his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, had been the driving force behind the attacks. By doing so they hope to spare their client the death penalty. Mr Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the bombings. The brothers set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line. Mr Tsarnaev is also accused of fatally shooting a police officer three days later. The prosecution says Mr Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya, had extremist views and wanted to hit back at the US in revenge for military action in Muslim countries.",

    "source": "Mr Kasyanov, a former prime minister, is a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the opposition RPR-Parnas party. Recently Mr Kadyrov called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\". Russian opposition politicians have described the posting as a murder threat. The Chechen leader said Mr Kasyanov was seeking cash in Strasbourg for the opposition. \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" he warned. Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Mr Nemtsov was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade. Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally. Mr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - his private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination. He has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged him to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s. The new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom he accuses of working for the West. It shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16,000 \"likes\". Mr Kasyanov says he sees it as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Ilya Yashin, who co-chairs RPR-Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video \"an open threat to murder Kasyanov\". Another opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said (in Russian) \"there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by them too\". The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on his own initiative. One theory discussed on Russian social media is that he is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate its critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest. Others suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes he is untouchable, our correspondent reports. The phrase \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" is the title of a thriller that Mr Kadyrov says he has filmed, starring himself as a machine gun-toting all-action hero. Kadyrov the Instagram fan - by Stephen Ennis, BBC Monitoring:. Ramzan Kadyrov is one of Russia's most popular and controversial Instagram users. Since launching his account in 2013, he has made over 6,000 posts and amassed 1.6m followers. He promotes himself on the site as a devout Muslim and a strong leader. One recent post featured him grappling with a crocodile. This is not the first time he has used Instagram to lash out at the Russian opposition. In May 2015, hours after the premiere of an Open Russia film about him, he posted a clip of himself firing a machine gun, with the slogan \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it soon!\" The following day Open Russia co-ordinator Vladimir Kara-Murza was taken seriously ill with poisoning. Instagram has rapidly grown in popularity in Russia in recent years and at the end of 2015 had more than 10m active users.",

But subsequently, through his spokesman, he had asked for an apology and retraction, which Mr McGinn refused to make. The MP said he then texted the Labour leader to make clear no offence was intended and reiterate that their friendship was important to him and asking for a meeting.

The UN should not wait until small ripples turn into huge waves before thinking of how to get to the shore. Josephat Ombuna, Nairobi, Kenya. @Jackalchachal thinks North Korea should be invited to talks:. North Korea needs to be accountable for its actions like any country. It's time for the world to have some serious dialogue with them. If you want to have nuclear weapons then you need to be trusted and must abide the rules. This would be the first big step to resolve this issue. Let's invite Kim Jong-un to the United Nations in New York and get down to business. Chris, Northfield, Vermont USA. @SouljaTroy1996 has a simple solution:. In my opinion sanctions are the way to go, if at all possible.  Unfortunately this may cause more hardship on the people of the North. War is out of the question - we are fighting enough wars in the Middle East.  I have thought deeply about this question for a while now (still am) , with China being an ally this would also be a concern for NATO.  Kim Jong-un is a loose cannon and unpredictable and that makes him a threat. Robert Anderson, Dundee, Scotland UK. I think we need to be prepared for any possible threat of them using weapons such as these. However, I don't think we should charge in and force North Korea to stop producing nuclear weapons. That is of course assuming they have been successful in making them. If we or any other countries for that matter become aggressive to them, the retaliation could be much worse. It's best to prepare for the worst but mainly ignore them. It's not like many of the countries condemning North Korea's actions have any moral high ground when they themselves are sat upon a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. It's like a child in a playground showing off their strength, if they are not challenged they won't have the opportunity to show their force in a fight. Mark, Kingswinford, West Midlands, England UK. The former NBA basketball player, Dennis Rodman who has had a number of well publicised meetings with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is cited by @ZZR600E3 as someone who could help:.

    "source": "The University and College Union says the 1.1% rise offered by the universities is \"an insult\". But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was \"disappointing given the very good pay offer\". Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases. \"A 1.1% pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5% pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay,\" said general secretary Sally Hunt. \"Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative. \"If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer.\" Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished. A spokesman for the employers anticipated only \"minor impact and minimal student disruption\". \"Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,\" said the spokesman. \"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer.\" The employers say the offer is \"at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year\". They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics. But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted members. Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected. Any action would take place during the autumn term, said a Unison spokeswoman. UCU is planning strike rallies in:.

He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. \"I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,\" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as \"brilliant\". \"That's what I want to give to youngsters,\" he says. \"Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it.\" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then \"it doesn't matter what age you are\". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. \"Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,\" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). \"The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football.\" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. \"All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,\" Rebecca Sellar explains. \"So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it.\" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: \"Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.\"",

The pair will receive 8 million Swedish krona (\u00c2\u00a3744,652) from the committee. Mr Hart, who was woken with the news at 4.40am, said his first reaction had been to hug his wife and wake his younger son. Mr Holmstrom said he felt \"very lucky\" and \"grateful\". The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that Mr Hart and Mr Holmstrom's work was \"valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions\". It also said it could identify \"potential pitfalls in contract design.\" Working separately, the two created tools to help determine whether public sector workers should receive fixed salaries or performance-based pay, and whether providers of public services should be publicly or privately owned. Mr Holmstrom in particular is known for his research into how contracts and incentives affect corporate behaviour. The former Nokia board member declined to say whether he thought executive pay was too high these days, but commented: \"My personal view is that [top executives' contracts] are too complicated today.\" Mr Holmstrom, aged 67, is a professor of economics and management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Mr Hart, born in 1948, is an economics professor at Harvard University in the US. The pair saw off competition from the World Bank's new chief economist Paul Romer, who was widely tipped to win. New York University's Stern Business School, where Prof Romer teaches, sparked controversy last Thursday when it accidently published a press release naming him as the winner. It quickly took down the release, saying it was only preparing for a possible win. Others believed to be the running included Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and Edward Lazear, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. The economics prize is the only Nobel not created by Alfred Nobel, and was instead launched in 1968, long after the philanthropist's death. To date Americans have dominated the award, with 55 of the 76 laureates holding US citizenship, including those with dual nationalities. Last year Scottish-born economist Angus Deaton won the prize for his use of data to investigate income inequality and inform economic policy. It is the fifth Nobel to be announced this year, after prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and peace were awarded last week.

    "source": "The Scottish government has already drafted legislation for a referendum after Nicola Sturgeon said another ballot was highly likely in the wake of the UK voting to leave the EU. But Ms Sturgeon told STV News that any referendum would not been held in 2017. Her predecessor, Alex Salmond, has predicted a vote on independence will be held in the autumn of next year. Ms Sturgeon said: \"There is not going to be an independence referendum in 2017, I don't think there is anybody who thinks that is the case.\" She has previously said a vote on independence will be held if the Scottish government concludes it is the only way to protect Scotland's place in Europe. Ms Sturgeon has urged the UK government to negotiate a so-called soft Brexit and retain its membership of the single market. Failing that, she wants a special arrangement to allow Scotland to stay in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. The first minister's latest comments regarding the timing of a second referendum follow her insistence at the weekend that she is not bluffing on calling a re-run of the 2014 ballot if Scotland's position is ignored. But she has also indicated that a soft Brexit could take the issue off the table in the short-term. Ms Sturgeon told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"We have to ask ourselves in Scotland are we happy to have the direction of our country, the kind of country we want to be, determined by a right-wing Conservative government perhaps for the next 20 years, or do we want to take control of our own future?\" \"That's the case that in those circumstances, I think, it would be right for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide.\" Asked if she was looking at a referendum \"much quicker\" than in five or 10 years' time if there was a hard Brexit, she said: \"I would think, yes. But let me not get away from this point, I'm putting to Theresa May a compromise solution.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ruling out an independence referendum this year was an \"empty gesture\" by Ms Sturgeon. Accusing the first minister of \"leaving Scotland in limbo\", Ms Davidson added: \"If she's serious about allowing Scotland to move on from constitutional navel-gazing, she should ditch her draft referendum bill immediately.\" Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said: \"While it is welcome that Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out another independence referendum in 2017, this doesn't come close to ending the uncertainty. \"The first minister should rule out forcing another independence referendum on the people of Scotland altogether, not just for the next twelve months.\" But the Scottish Greens welcomed the Scottish government' commitment to keeping a second referendum on the table. Co-convenor Patrick Harvie said: \"This cannot be a quiet time ahead for supporters of independence; although the Brexit negotiations will take two years, work must begin now to build support and strengthen our case.\"",

A federal investigation found racial bias in the Ferguson police department was widespread. Two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black and now half the council. Shortly after the results came out, a video emerged showing an unarmed black man being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina. State investigators said the officer, Michael Slager, would be charged with murder after the video showed him firing at Walter Lamer Scott who was running away. Turnout in Ferguson increased from 12% at the last elections, in 2013, to 29%. Wesley Bell, who defeated another black candidate in Ferguson's third ward, said: \"This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard. \"When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.\" A drive by activists to register new voters and encourage previously disenfranchised residents to vote appeared to have paid off. \"People in general want to see change,\" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Reuters news agency. Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in Ferguson's first ward to become the first black woman on the council. Black residents in Ferguson protested for several days last August after Mr Brown was shot dead by St Louis police officer Darren Wilson. The protests spread nationwide in November when it was announced that Mr Wilson, who has since left the police, would not be charged.

    "source": "PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering. His comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off. One train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre. Migrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\" Follow our live updates. EU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives. Many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear. And then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions. International services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\". During a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. \"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\" Mr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense. \"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\" European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. EU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. Mr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. He said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\" The human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media. Czech unease at migrant numbering. Five obstacles to an EU migrants deal. Those who risk everything for a better life. The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another\". A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum.

    "source": "Mr Pistorius says he mistakenly shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through the door, believing she was a burglar, then broke it down with the bat. The prosecution says he tried to beat down the door and then fired the gun. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing Ms Steenkamp in February 2013. Forensic expert Police Colonel Johan Vermeulen also said he thought Mr Pistorius had hit the door with the bat from a low angle, indicating he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Pretoria. A big day in the Oscar Pistorius murder case. The defence worked tirelessly to disprove a finding by Colonel Johan Vermeulen, a decorated forensic expert in the South African Police Service (SAPS). Oscar Pistorius's toilet door stood obtrusively in the courtroom, held up by a white frame, behind it a toilet cubicle. Col Vermeulen, a state witness, told the court that based on the marks on the door and their level Mr Pistorius was on his stumps when he struck the door with a cricket bat. The defence strongly challenged his version, adding that they will present their own expert witness who will prove Mr Pistorius was in fact wearing his prosthetics. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also introduced another dimension to the case, suggesting that the police recklessly handled the crime scene - he pointed to police shoe prints on the door. The forensics from the scene are a make or break for either side. Mr Roux's plan seems to include discrediting the integrity of the evidence collection process. He has already hinted at the possible contamination of the crime scene, placing the SAPS under a rather embarrassing spotlight. This contradicts the athlete's claim that he had been wearing his artificial limbs. Correspondents say whether or not the athlete was on his prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp, or expose inconsistencies in it. The damaged toilet door, with four bullet holes, was examined in the courtroom along with a replica of the toilet cubicle. Forensic evidence on the location from which shots were fired, how they were grouped and their trajectory were presented to the court on Wednesday. Cross-examining, Mr Pistorius' defence team asked forensic expert Col Vermeulen to kneel and lift his feet, which caused him to wobble. The defence team claimed that Mr Pistorius therefore would not have been able to balance on his stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat. Defence lawyer Barry Roux also alleged that police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door. Col Vermeulen argued that if Mr Pistorius was balanced enough to fire a gun, he could also break down a door with a bat. The forensics expert argued that the angle and location of the marks on the door suggested that they had been caused by someone much shorter than him. The defence team argued that a mark on the bottom of the door showed where Mr Pistorius had tried to kick open the door using his prosthetic legs. Col Vermeulen agreed that this was possible. \"The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots,\" he told the court. The prosecution argues that Mr Pistorius hit the door with the cricket bat before the shots were fired, but the defence claims it was the other way round. The trial is now halfway through its second week. Earlier on Wednesday, a friend of Mr Pistorius claimed that the star had driven at 200 km/h (124mph) and that he had taken a picture of the speedometer to prove it. The defence team alleged that Darren Fresco was himself driving at the time and had therefore fabricated evidence. On Tuesday, Mr Pistorius' defence team questioned a pathologist's finding that his girlfriend had eaten less than two hours before he killed her. This contradicts the athlete's account that the pair had been in bed for several hours before the shooting. The state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius and Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, and reality TV star, had an argument before the athlete fired the shots that killed her. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty, the 27-year-old, a national sporting hero dubbed the \"blade runner\", could face life imprisonment.",

The discovery was made as part of an investigation into claims by a local historian that up to 800 babies and young children died at the home and were buried in unmarked graves. Amnesty International has said that archaeological surveys should be carried out at all former mother-and-baby homes in Northern Ireland. Archbishop Martin said many in the church and society were \"ashamed\" of what had emerged at the home in Tuam. He added that \"families are owed an apology\" and that the Church had repeated an apology it made in 2014 when the claims \"first came to light\". \"It makes me feel awful. I feel incredibly sad in recent days. We as a Church do not want to repeat the awful mistakes of the past.\" He added: \"It's an appalling time for us and everyone in society. \"We're opening up a whole chapter in the society in Ireland and the rest of the world where there was a terrible stigma against unwed mothers. \"There was a terrible time, we in society and in the Church isolated and stigmatised them.\" Meanwhile, the Irish children's minister Katherine Zappone has said that 474 \"unclaimed infant remains\" from mother-and-baby homes were transferred to medical schools between 1940 and 1965. Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c3\u2030 made claims about the transfer of remains in a 2011 documentary. Ms Zappone told the D\u00c3\u00a1il (Irish parliament) that the transfer of remains was \"part of a tapestry of oppression, abuse and systematic human rights violations that took place all over this country for decades\". She also said an interim report into the home in Tuam would be published by the end of March, a move Archbishop Martin said the Catholic Church supported.",

    "source": "Have the media lost interest? Is it a question of chronic political fatigue? Are our brains simply not wired to think long-term? The BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses. Max Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago. \"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter. \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:. \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up. \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it. \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained. \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this. \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act. \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away. \"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\" We also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:. The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT. Listen to the programme. Download the programme. \"'What can I do about this global problem? I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.' \"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives. \"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'. \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests. Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media. \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions. \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science. \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission. \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.  If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling? \"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions. \"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

Vicky Cherry, 44, had been missing for 15 months when police found her body wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheeting at a house in Toronto Street, Bolton, in January. Andrew Reade, 43, admitted preventing the lawful burial of a body and perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to four years and four months in jail. Miss Cherry's cause of death could not be ascertained because of heavy decomposition but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation, as injuries to her neck were detected. Sentencing Reade, Judge Timothy Clayson said the defendant could not be held responsible for Miss Cherry's death but what followed was \"inexcusable\". Officers had launched a \"non-body\" murder investigation because Miss Cherry, from Fulwood, Lancashire had not been seen since October 2015. Reade, of Toronto Street, Bolton, told her family they had split up and she had moved to Blackburn. However, police discovered that her unemployment benefits were still being withdrawn in Bolton. When officers arrested Reade on suspicion of murder, he claimed he had panicked upon waking to find his girlfriend dead after they had binged on a cocktail of drugs. The 43-year-old admitted hiding her body and lying to her family and police. He also admitted taking her benefits for several months after her death. In a victim statement to the court, Miss Cherry's daughter said: \"Reade has held her body in a cupboard with things on top of her like she was a piece of rubbish. \"I will never forgive Reade. Reade himself is the only person who truly knows what happened to my mother. We will be forever tormented by this.\" Nick Ross, defending, said his client, a long-standing user of Class A drugs, had exercised \"very poor judgment\" after grief and panic had set in following Miss Cherry's death. \"He wishes he could turn the clock back,\" he said. Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: \"Reade's deliberately deceptive and misleading actions seriously obstructed the investigation into how Vicky died and cost us valuable opportunities to investigate.\"",

    "source": "He was addressing supporters outside his Istanbul residence who were chanting for capital punishment to be restored. EU officials have warned that Turkey's bid to join the bloc would be finished if Ankara restored the death penalty. Mr Erdogan has overseen a crackdown since the coup attempt was quashed. Thousands of police officers, military personnel and judges have been suspended or arrested. Turkey's Western allies have expressed concern and urged President Erdogan to respond in a measured way. But speaking to his supporters on Tuesday morning, the president said Turkey was \"a democratic state run by the rule of law\". He said he was ready to reinstate the death penalty if the Turkish people demanded it and parliament approved the legislation, adding: \"You cannot put aside the people's demands.\" \"Today is there no capital punishment in America? In Russia? In China? In countries around the world? Only in European Union countries is there no capital punishment,\" he said. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its bid to become a member of the EU. On Monday, Mr Erdogan said suggestions that he was using the coup attempt to crack down on his political opponents were \"libel\". \"I'd like to know what a crackdown by Tayyip Erdogan looks like... It's just libel,\" he said. \"If Tayyip Erdogan was an oppressive figure, he wouldn't have won 52% of the vote at the presidential elections.\" Also on Monday, one of the coup's alleged ringleaders, the air force commander Gen Akin Ozturk, appeared in court. The general, who appeared to have several recent injuries, denied any involvement in the uprising. At least 232 people were killed and 1,400 wounded in fighting after rebel troops sealed off bridges in Istanbul, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationed tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Many later surrendered. Officials have blamed the unrest on the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and the \"parallel structure\" they say he has formed to topple the government. Mr Erdogan insists the US should extradite Mr Gulen, warning that it \"should not keep such a terrorist\". US Secretary of State John Kerry has said Turkey would need to provide \"evidence, not allegations\" against Mr Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the plot. The Turkish interior ministry dismissed almost 9,000 police officers on Monday as part of a purge of officials suspected of involvement in the coup attempt. That followed the arrest of 6,000 military personnel and suspension of almost 3,000 judges over the weekend.",

One mother recounted how her five-year-old daughter was murdered while trying to protect her from rape. She said a man \"took out a long knife and killed her by slitting her throat\". In another case, an eight-month-old baby was reportedly killed while five security officers gang-raped his mother. An estimated 65,000 members of the Muslim minority community have fled to Bangladesh since violence broke out in Myanmar - also known as Burma - last October. Nearly half of those interviewed by the UN said a family member had been killed. Of 101 women interviewed, 52 said they had been raped or experienced sexual violence from the security forces. Many told investigators that members of the army or police had burned hundreds of Rohingya homes, schools, markets, shops, and mosques. Numerous testimonies \"confirmed that the army deliberately set fire to houses with families inside, and in other cases pushed Rohingyas into already burning houses\", the report states. Many victims said they were taunted as they were being beaten or raped, with the perpetrators telling them: \"What can your Allah do for you? See what we can do?\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein said: \"The cruelty to which these Rohingya children have been subjected is unbearable - what kind of hatred could make a man stab a baby crying out for his mother's milk? \"I call on the international community, with all its strength, to join me in urging the leadership in Myanmar to bring such military operations to an end.\" The country's government and its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi have previously dismissed claims of rights abuses and insisted that the security forces follow the rule of law.

Llanberis Mountain Rescue was called out a record 43 times to Wales and England's highest peak in August - an increase it called \"unsustainable\". Visit Wales' recent year of adventure campaign encouraged to visitors to \"Find Your Epic\". The tourism body said the campaign was \"an opportunity to promote safety\". Llanberis Mountain Rescue said many of those tackling the peak were unprepared in terms of knowledge and equipment, with many needing assistance. Chairman of the team of volunteers, Rob Johnson, said \"serious consideration\" needed to be given to how the 3,560 ft (1,085m) peak was managed. He said the drive to attract tourists contributed to an \"unsustainable\" rise in callouts - from 34 in August 2015 to 43 in August 2016. The organisation relies on donations and about 1,000 volunteer hours were spent attending incidents - including an RAF helicopter crash landing. He said many of the callouts were preventable and, with the right knowledge and equipment, they could have been avoided. \"We've attended a variety of incidents this summer but the most common have been lower-leg injuries, people too tired to continue and people crag-fast on Crib Goch,\" said Mr Johnson. \"It has been a massive commitment from a small group of volunteers.\" Visit Wales, the Welsh Government's tourism team, said it encouraged visitors to participate in activities with accredited providers. A spokeswoman added: \"The year of adventure is also an opportunity to promote safety in the great outdoors. \"Mountain rescue teams do great work in helping people, but as the adventure sector continues to grow there is no doubt rescue teams will need the help of educators in minimising the risk of people needing their assistance. \"That's why we will continue to work with partners and the industry so that people can enjoy Wales and be safe.\"",

Last month, the Assembly rejected a motion calling for the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Dr Colton also said he hoped the church would one day recognise same-sex marriages in religious ceremonies. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme that it was a very \"divisive\" debate. \"The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate,\" he said. \"I certainly support civil same sex marriage. \"I also recognise that the church of Ireland's definition of marriage is for itself and I adhere to that discipline... but that is not to say that everyone must be required to take the church of Ireland's view of marriage. \"Having said that I'm also among those in the church, and perhaps we're only a minority, albeit a significant one that long to see the day when we can have a discussion -  as we've had discussions over the years on all sorts of other issues about the nature of marriage -  with a view, ultimately, at least to the blessing of same sex couples following civil unions if not to their marriage in church as is happening in other parts of the Anglican communion.\" The Church of Ireland's LGBT affirming group, Changing Attitude Ireland, welcomed the comments. Chairman Dr Richard O'Leary said:  \"The bishop's acknowledgement of the hurt that the church has inflicted on its gay and lesbian members is greatly appreciated especially as it comes on the day we are holding services to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT)\". Last month,  Stormont  rejected same-sex marriage for the third time in 18 months. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year. Ahead of the assembly motion, the Church of Ireland restated its position on same-sex marriage, repeating what was affirmed at its general synod in 2012. \"The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord's teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side. The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage,\" it said. Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland wrote an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the  motion. The letter said the motion undermined the principle of equality by applying it \"inappropriately\".",

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman said it could create a \"conducive environment for a more inclusive way forward to tackle the underlying causes of the violence, including the condition of the Muslim communities in Rakhine\". What sparked the violence in June? The rape and murder of a young Buddhist woman in Rakhine in May set off a chain of deadly religious clashes. Why was a state of emergency declared? To allow the military to take over administrative control of the region. Who are the Rohingyas? The UN describes them as a persecuted religious and linguistic minority from western Burma. The Burmese government says they are relatively recent migrants from the Indian sub-continent. Bangladesh already hosts several hundred thousand refugees from Burma and says it cannot take any more. Q&A: Rakhine unrest. Rohingyas recount terror. Burma profile. A statement on Thein Sein's website said on Friday the 27-member commission would include representatives from different political parties and also religious organisations. It said the commission would submit its findings next month. The violence in Rakhine state began in late May when a Buddhist woman was raped and murdered by three Muslims. A mob later killed 10 Muslims in retaliation, though they were unconnected with the earlier incident. Sectarian clashes spread across the state, with houses of both Buddhists and Muslims being burnt down. The UNHCR has said that about 80,000 people have been displaced in and around the Sittwe and Maungdaw by the violence.

    "source": "But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. \"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed. \"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself. Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US. This means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet. \"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe. Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer. The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire. \"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan. \"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says. After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially. So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge. Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country. But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning. \"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander. \"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage. \"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

    "source": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. \"I feel that I am more tired than I was before,\" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. \"During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy.\" Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (\u00c2\u00a31.1m; $1.3m). \"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. \"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says. \"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\" Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. \"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. \"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. \"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\" On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. \"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. \"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests. \"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. \"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says. \"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\" \"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. \"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. \"It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.\" Listen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.",

    "source": "Media playback is not supported on this device. The Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season. He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead. Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end. Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go. However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap. Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement. The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace. Alonso said: \"It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead. \"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure. \"But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade. At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion. Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6. It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag. The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint. Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place. Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier. Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position. Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres. Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap. Vettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking. \"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\" Button said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end. \"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push. \"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back. \"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.\" Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid. On the way, Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta. Schumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez. Hulkenberg and Di Resta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th.",

In future a unified patent court will hear patent cases. There will be up to four divisional courts in the UK - but there were originally no plans to have one in Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates had urged UK ministers to step in and change the law. That has now happened, with Scotland's Court of Session being appointed as a venue for these claims, provided there is enough demand. Gill Grassie, a member of the Law Society of Scotland's intellectual property law committee said: \"We are delighted that the UK government has listened to our concerns. \"This is an important and very welcome step towards the goal that we have been aiming to achieve for the benefit of Scotland's IP rich business community. \"If we can secure the ultimate realisation of this goal sooner rather than later this will give businesses in Scotland, which rely upon patents to protect valuable technologies and innovation, assurance that they will be able to enforce and defend their rights in future in a local court. \"Thus they will be enabled to secure the benefits this will give in terms of costs savings, convenience and certainty.\" The SNP's Pete Wishart, who had campaigned for the change, said it means inventors in Scotland will no longer have to go to a more distant court in London or Europe to enforce their rights. He said: \"This is a fantastic victory for the legal establishment in Scotland.  I raised these concerns through all stages of the intellectual Property Bill and am very pleased that in response to my amendments today the UK government have said that we can secure a divisional court if we can demonstrate demand. \"Not only is there demand in Scotland but there is also centuries of experience, skills and expertise in dealing with patent case in Scotland. \"It would have been patently absurd for Scotland to be denied a divisional patent court with our tradition of invention and creativity and this is great news for all businesses associated with developing our creative economy in Scotland.\" Last year, countries across Europe backed the changes to patent laws designed to help inventors protect their ideas right across the continent.",

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk. At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays. The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem. Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents. \"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\". FGM includes procedures that remove or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility, mental health problems, complications in childbirth and increased risk of death for newborns. Two men were charged last month, in connection with performing FGM, under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. They were the first people in Britain to face such charges.

On the first anniversary of Storm Desmond, experts say November to January were the wettest three months since UK records began in 1910. Review author Terry Marsh said flooding was \"extensive and repetitive\". Storm Desmond began battering parts of the UK on 5 December, depositing a record month's worth of rain on Cumbria in just one day. About 5,200 homes were flooded in Cumbria and Lancashire, while tens of thousands more lost power after an electricity sub-station in Lancaster was flooded. The storm caused an estimated insurance bill of more than \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. Major storms \"Abigail\", \"Frank\" and \"Gertrude\" also hit the UK last winter. A study by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), in collaboration with the British Hydrological Society, found many rivers across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland saw record peak flows during the three-month period. It found the rivers Eden, Tyne and Lune in England saw record peaks of around 1,700 cubic metres per second. Experts say such levels could fill London's Royal Albert Hall in less than a minute. Although last winter's floods were more extreme in scale, flooding in 1947 had a greater impact in terms of homes flooded and crops destroyed, the appraisal found. However, lead author Terry Marsh from CEH said the national scale of last winter's floods were \"the most extreme on record\". \"The associated flooding was both extensive and repetitive, and total river outflows from Great Britain following the passage of Storm Desmond in December exceeded the previous maximum by a substantial margin,\" he said.",

    "source": "He also suggested they should not be eligible for tax credits. It comes as a survey suggests 77% of Britons want to see immigration cut. The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January. But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further. He said the cost of migrants claiming in-work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government's calculations. \"We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits,\" he told BBC News. And he said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration. \"Even if I thought, which I don't, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years. Labour said it supported the government's three-month ban, which it said was \"reasonable and achievable\". Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal. \"We are doing all that we can within the law,\" said a No 10 spokesman. Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in their native countries. The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three-quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56% want to see a major crackdown. Almost half of those surveyed, 47%, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31% of respondents who said it was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway. The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday. Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government's target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by 2015 is \"not helpful\" and will almost certainly not be achieved. Mr Cable, who has sought to distance himself from the net migration target in the past, calling it a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be \"practical\" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled. \"It involves British people emigrating - you can't control that. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,\" he says. \"Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. It almost certainly won't achieve the below-100,000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let's be practical about it.\" Labour said the \"gap between the government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence\". Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad. David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating -  from more than 250,000 a year to less than 100,000 by the next election in 2015. After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167,000 to 182,000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries. Asked last month if that meant it would be impossible to meet his target, Mr Cameron said: \"'I don't accept that.\" \"If you take the whole three-year period [since the election], net immigration is down by around third.\" He said some measures the government had taken, such as closing \"bogus\" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact. In Nick Robinson's documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which he was a prominent member \"got it wrong\" on immigration, \"and I deeply regret it\". Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds: \"We didn't spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.\" Nigel Farage tells the programme: \"They tried to rubbish us, they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and actually this has been going on ever since [Enoch] Powell's speech.\" In the so-called \"rivers of blood\" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain's immigration policy was like watching a nation \"heaping up its own funeral pyre\". He was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said it was \"inflammatory and liable to damage race relations\". Asked whether he thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says: \"He was right for the wrong reasons. He was wrong in the sense that he felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately he's been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now \"promise to control\" immigration because they are \"acutely aware of the high level of public concern\" about it. In the programme, he looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration. The paper concluded that there was \"little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration\". Its author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said: \"I think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let's face it there will be some: 'Yes, we're doing this for the good of our country, and yes you may lose out, but ultimately we still have to do this.' \"Just as we said to the coal miners 30 years ago: 'Sorry we can get our coal a lot cheaper abroad. We can't afford to keep on propping you up.'\" The Truth About Immigration is to be broadcast on BBC Two at 21:30 GMT on Tuesday, 7 January.",

David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding. Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards. The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th. Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests. Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross. After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate. Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:. \"It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it. \"It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid. \"We haven't got what we deserved from recent games.

They started well, but we got to grips with that. \"We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal.

    "source": "Three of those executed had been convicted of an attack in Tiananmen Square in Beijing last October, in which five people died, Xinhua said. The others were found guilty of crimes including bomb-making and arson. The government has accused separatist militants based in Xinjiang of carrying out a string of recent attacks. Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs, who speak a distinct language and have different customs to the majority Han population elsewhere in China. Huseyin Guxur, Yusup Wherniyas and Yusup Ehmet were \"deprived of political rights for life\" because of their role in the deadly car crash on Tiananmen Square in October 2013, Xinhua said. \"They masterminded the terrorist attack,\" the news agency added. In the incident, a car rammed into bystanders on the politically important Beijing square before bursting into flames. Two tourists died, along with three of the attackers. Xinhua named some of the other men who were executed along with the Tiananmen attack perpetrators:. Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uighur Congress exile group, called the executions \"a typical case of the law serving political ends\". Chinese officials often attribute attacks in Xinjiang to Uighur separatists, accusing them of seeking to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. Beijing has recently blamed them for an attack in May at a market in Urumqi, that left at least 31 people dead. It also accused them of being behind a mass knife attack in the southern province of Yunnan in March, in which 29 were killed and more than 130 injured. Uighur leaders deny they are co-ordinating a terrorist campaign. They say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang have provoked the unrest. Who are the Uighurs?",

The Australian defeated 11-time world champion Kelly Slater, but fell out of the semi-finals to Brazilian Adriano de Souza, who claimed his first WSL crown. Mr de Souza paid tribute to Fanning saying \"he deserved it more than me\". There has been strong support after a grieving Fanning won his Pipeline quarter-finals heat on Wednesday. The Australian broke down in an interview after his winning heat, not long after learning of his brother's death. He later posted on social media that it was one of the most challenging days of his life. \"I am so grateful for the incredible love and well wishes that have come my way since learning of my eldest brother's passing,\" Fanning said on Instagram. \"Like all my big brothers, Peter will always be a hero to me... I knew I could find the strength to take part in the final event of the season because that's what Pete would want.\" It has not been disclosed how or where Peter Fanning died. Mick Fanning came close to losing his own life in July after being forced to fight off a shark during a competition in South Africa. Mick's mother, who is currently with him in Hawaii, said she was overwhelmed by the live televised footage of his close encounter with the shark. \"I just saw my boy going down. That was absolutely terrifying because I have lost a son before,\" Liz Osborne told Fairfax media. Fanning's other brother, Sean, died in a car accident in 1998. Immediately after clinching the Pipeline Masters title, Adriano de Souza spoke of conflicting emotions going into the final day of competition. \"I wish so much to give a hug to Mick's mum, but it's kind of scary as we are in a world title race and I didn't want to mix it up,\" de Souza said. \"I think Mick deserved it more than me, he's such a strong man, a three-time world champion.

The inquest heard two police officers went to the home of Mr Pimlott's parents after his father called 999. His father Kelvin said his son had a can of petrol and was threatening to set fire to the building. The inquest previously heard the dead man had been served with a restraining order preventing him contacting his parents or going near their home. After PC Peter Hodgkinson and PC David Beer arrived at the scene, they saw Mr Pimlott, who was in the back garden, douse himself in petrol from a can and strike a match. \"I deployed the Taser to reduce the risk the of harm to Mr Pimlott,\" said PC Hodgkinson. \"I tried to engage with him to put down the can. I believe he was going to set himself alight so I fired the Taser.\" PC Beer said: \"I heard the Taser sound being activated and Mr Pimlott went up in flames.\" Independent fire investigator Steven Andrews said he made a \"very strong finding\" that Mr Pimlott was set on fire by the Taser.

    "source": "\"It is with tremendous sadness that we announce the death of our beautiful, dynamic and one-of-a-kind mother,\" the statement said. The British-born writer, sister of actress Joan Collins, died in Los Angeles, her spokeswoman said. Collins's raunchy novels of the rich and famous sold more than 500 million copies in 40 countries. In a career spanning four decades, all 32 of her novels appeared in the New York Times bestseller list. The family statement said the writer lived \"a wonderfully full life\", adored by family, friends and readers. \"She was a true inspiration, a trailblazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,\" it added. Collins was diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer six-and-a-half years ago, according to US celebrity magazine People. She told the magazine in her last interview on 14 September that she had told few people about her diagnosis other than her three daughters, and did not regret her decision. \"I did it my way, as Frank Sinatra would say,\" she said. \"I've written five books since the diagnosis, I've lived my life, I've travelled all over the world, I have not turned down book tours and no-one has ever known until now when I feel as though I should come out with it.\" She was in the UK less than a fortnight ago on a promotional tour for her latest book. Her sister Joan, 82, who only learned the news herself in the last fortnight, told People magazine she was \"completely devastated\". \"She was my best friend. I admire how she handled this. She was a wonderful, brave and a beautiful person and I love her,\" she said. Jackie Collins, who was born in London, began writing as a teenager, making up racy stories for her schoolfriends, according to a biography on her website. Her first novel, The World is Full of Married Men, was published in 1968 and became a scandalous bestseller. It was banned in Australia and branded \"disgusting\" by romance writer Barbara Cartland. In 1985, her novel Hollywood Wives was made into a mini-series by ABC, starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen. Collins said that she \"never felt bashful writing about sex\". \"I think I've helped people's sex lives,\" she said. \"Sex is a driving force in the world so I don't think it's unusual that I write about sex. I try to make it erotic, too.\" Collins had lost her mother, second husband and fiance to cancer. She told the Press Association earlier this month that she had chosen to celebrate life rather than mourn those she had lost. \"I refuse to mourn people, because everybody dies,\" she said. \"Death and taxes, you can't avoid either\". Private memorial services are due to be held for her family in both the UK and in the US.",

Martin crashed at the Isle of Man TT in June while the Honda machine has suffered mechanical problems this year. \"Naturally I'm disappointed but it's not surprising given the difficulties the team has experienced,\" said UGP clerk of the course Noel Johnston. He added: \"I had hoped for a different outcome as Guy is obviously a big fan favourite, and he's never made any secret in the past of his love for the circuit, which after all is the international where he's had the most success over the years. \"I'm sure the decision hasn't been taken lightly by him or the team and I wish Guy well, whatever the next step in his career may be. \"Putting this news aside, I'm very happy with the strength of this year's entry. We've seen some incredible performances this season from the likes of Peter Hickman, Michael Dunlop and Dean Harrison in particular, and I've no doubt they will bring the same spectacular form to Dundrod. \"Everyone will be there trying to end their season on a high, and the field is wide open - I think we could see a few dark horses in the mix and ready to make their mark at the world's fastest road race.\"",

Dale Merza, 20, is charged with misdemeanour hazing after the alleged attack last October on Andrew Seely, 19, at Central Michigan University. Mr Seely, who was sleeping at the time of the incident, sought medical treatment for serous facial swelling. The accused could get 93 days in jail and a $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3800) fine if convicted. Mr Merza's legal representative told the Detroit Free Press his client, who was charged on Friday in Isabella County District Court, was innocent. \"This case has been blown way out of proportion by the individual's family members, who were not present and don't have any of the facts,\" lawyer Bruce Leach told the newspaper. It is an induction ritual meted out typically to new members of the US college men and women's social clubs known as fraternities and sororities, but also to military recruits. The practice can include physical violence, sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or degrading and dangerous \"pranks\" such as forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. It is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high-profile deaths including that of Florida A&M University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off-campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. His mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying: \"He could have been killed.\" The accounting student only told his family what had happened months afterwards. He blamed the incident for his decision to leave the college. The teenager's father, Paul Seely, told CBS News his son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered his mouth. The Seely family said their son had made known to other members of the fraternity that he had a severe peanut allergy, for which he carries medication. The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho condemned the incident, saying it did not condone such behaviour. \"Alpha Chi Rho is appalled and upset by the actions taken by individuals against Andrew Seely,\" said its statement.",

    "source": "Lithuania violated an article on free elections in the European Convention on Human Rights, the ruling said. Mr Paksas was impeached and removed from office as president after the Baltic state's constitutional court found that he had abused his position. He is now a Euro MP in Strasbourg. The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday is binding, meaning that Lithuania, an EU member state, will have to act on it to prevent any similar violation in future. But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying their ruling was in itself \"sufficient just satisfaction\". Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One (Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2004 Mr Paksas became the first European head of state in modern times to be impeached and removed from office. The former Soviet republic's constitutional court found that he had illegally arranged Lithuanian citizenship for a Russian-born businessman, Yuri Borisov. But Mr Paksas, an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times, was cleared of the charge of having leaked state secrets to Russia. After the constitutional court had backed Mr Paksas's disqualification, the Lithuanian parliament adopted a new electoral rule barring anyone from becoming an MP if they had previously been dismissed in impeachment proceedings. Mr Paksas complained that the rule had been passed deliberately to bar him from office. He also said the constitutional court had lacked impartiality and had exceeded its powers. The Strasbourg judges accepted that a breach of the constitution was \"a particularly serious matter\", but they argued that Mr Paksas's permanent and irreversible disqualification from running for election was disproportionate. In 2009 Mr Paksas was elected to the European Parliament. He sits with the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which seeks to defend national sovereignty and prevent the further concentration of power in Brussels.",

    "source": "Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy in an exercise some parents said amounted to indoctrination. Officials said the schools were closed out of an \"abundance of caution\" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to: \"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region's religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school's doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because they were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, they said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non-religious example of Arabic. The decision to close the schools has drawn criticism as well. \"It looks like fear wins again,\" a resident told the News Virginian newspaper. On the paper's Facebook account, locals have been debating the closure with one man saying, \"our patriot forefathers are rolling in their graves,\" and another rhetorically posting, \"how do these terrified people leave their houses every day?\"",

    "source": "For this has been the worst year on this, or indeed any other, commissioner's watch. As the league closes in on an annual revenue of \u00a316bn ($25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up his bank balance with a yearly income in the region of \u00a326m ($40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale:. Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device. While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that:. Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made. There were also 9.6m tweets about the event across its three days. Nielsen, who gather audience ratings in the US, reported extremely strong numbers for the very first 9.30am EST kick-off between Detroit and Atlanta in London, so much so that the NFL will repeat the experiment next season. Although some fans showed their disdain for Rice, Peterson and others arrested last year by returning their replica shirts, many still turned up wearing Rice's number 27 jersey and Peterson's number 28 long after their cases made the national press. Despite everything, the NFL remains America's game. So why the appeal in the face of growing off-field problems? Simply put, the NFL is full of great stories, exceptional games and, most importantly, great players. The college version of the game is flourishing as well. Elsewhere in America, the other two major professional leagues - the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) - have suffered with falling television ratings and general popularity over the past few years. Baseball's lack of true star power means it has fallen out of the national conversation, arguably since 1998 and the infamous home-run record chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who have subsequently become embroiled in steroid controversies. The names of baseball's 2014 All Stars, such as Chase Utley, Nelson Cruz and Paul Goldschmidt, do not possess the same pulling power as football stars such as JJ Watt, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Calvin Johnson. Baseball simply is not cool anymore and the appeal for the game has become as much regional as it is national. Jonathan Mahler wrote in the New York Times recently that: \"Baseball has never been healthier\" - in terms of attendance, revenue, and, unlike the NFL and NBA, freedom from labour strife. \"So why does it feel so irrelevant?\" With each team playing 162 games a season, baseball fans tend to watch their own players in action rather than those they have no vested interest in. That is not the case for the NFL. Almost 19m watched the Dallas Cowboys take on the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The NBA has also suffered in the post-Michael Jordan years, with falling attendances and viewing figures. However basketball has been rescued somewhat by the LeBron James effect, while the game, with its ongoing connection with hip hop culture, continues to grow with a younger audience. Along with the phenomenon that is College Basketball's March Madness, it remains a popular sport in America, but continues to be dwarfed by the NFL. The NBA is, according to the Harris Report, America's sixth most popular sport but is struggling with the increase in popularity of soccer and a resurgence in appreciation for ice hockey. It would also be foolish to think that the NFL is the only organisation with off-field problems. Baseball continues to move from one steroid scandal to another, while the NBA has witnessed its own fair share of domestic violence, domestic assault, battery and driving under the influence cases. The NFL is a runaway success train that shows no sign of halting. And while the on-field product remains so good, the off-field issues will be nothing more than a distraction. Green Bay Packers fan Zoe Lake is representative of millions: \"Football has always been a part of my life. As a football fan and a woman, I believe the NFL needs to take a good, hard look at the way it has handled the epidemic of violence that has rocked the league and the nation. \"But recent events will not keep me from tuning in to catch my Packers. Let's not forget: It is only a small number of NFL players who have committed violent acts against women and children.\" In April's Draft, commissioner Goodell will welcome University of Oklahoma wide receiver Dorial Green Beckham into the professional ranks, potentially in the first round. Multiple drug arrests and a dismissal from the University of Missouri for allegedly forcing open an apartment door and pushing an 18-year-old woman down a flight of stairs will not stop him being given every opportunity to succeed on the field. Even if he transgresses again, it will be just another problem for America's most popular sport. But a problem it will overcome, have no doubt.",
    "reference": "As National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell stepped to the podium for his annual pre-Super Bowl address, he could have done worse than invoke the Queen's speech of 1992 in which HRH Elizabeth II referred to the events of the previous 12 months as an 'annus horribilis'.",
    "prediction": "When Roger Goodell steps down as NFL commissioner at the end of the season, it will be a fitting end to what has been an eventful year for the sport in America.",

    "source": "A week of protests to coincide with the race began on Friday, organised by the opposition to the ruling royal family. The New York Times reported that authorities in Bahrain were increasing security following a series of explosions in the country. Ecclestone told the AFP news agency: \"There's no reason why [the race] shouldn't be [a success].\" Asked about the demonstrations, he said: \"What's happened? They're demonstrating now? I didn't know that. There's nobody demonstrating.\" The explosions in Bahrain were reported to include a gas cylinder that set a car ablaze in the financial district of the capital Manama. Ecclestone added on Tuesday: \"We don't want to see trouble. We don't want to see people arguing and fighting about things we don't understand, because we really don't understand. Some people feel it's our fault there are problems. \"Last year I spoke to the people representing the protesters and I spoke to the people we deal with. It was really difficult to decide who is right and who is wrong. \"I'm happy to talk to anybody about this, as I did before,\" he said, citing his meetings with Bahraini opposition party al-Wefaq last year in London and the Middle East. The Bahrain authorities have promised \"appropriate security measures\" for the grand prix. \"The security situation is very reassuring,\" a government spokeswoman told state news agency BNA. She added that Bahrain \"will ensure appropriate security measures are taken during the F1 race and will take enough measures, as in all other countries which host such international sporting events\". The opposition and government resumed reconciliation talks in February for the first time since 2011, when protests were crushed and at least 35 people died, but little progress has been reported. Protestors have told the Reuters news agency they see an opportunity to use the race to highlight what they say are injustices still being committed against them. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was postponed and later cancelled after month-long pro-democracy protests were crushed. Ecclestone said he was \"extremely sympathetic\" to the opposition in Bahrain, adding: \"Don't forget, I was the one, when we had apartheid in South Africa, who pulled the race.\" Last year's race went ahead after Ecclestone and governing body the FIA said they had been assured the kingdom was safe for F1 personnel. Before the race, Force India mechanics were caught up in an incident in which a petrol bomb bounced off the roof of their car as protestors battled with police on the main highway from the circuit into Manama. The next day the team skipped the second practice session to ensure their personnel could return to their hotel before dark. But team deputy principal Bob Fernley said: \"Lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. I am not expecting any issues at all.\" Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel won the 2012 race, ahead of the Lotus pair of Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean.",

    "source": "He said payments to them for their image rights were \"the most significant risk in football\" faced by HMRC. Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted. HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs. Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: \"I think if it was me, I would want to review this... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.\" The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): \"Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in \u00a3158m in yield.\" Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. \"Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,\" she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed \u00a310m (\u20ac12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took \"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\" and \"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided\". The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday. Manchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho's arrival at the club and so it would not comment.",

Arsenal said they were \"extremely disappointed\" by the publication of the claims, \"which are without foundation\". Chelsea said the claims were \"false and entirely without foundation\" while leaders Leicester also denied them. Bonar himself broke his silence on the matter on Sunday evening, writing on Twitter that the newspaper's claims were \"false and very misleading\". \"I have never had a relationship with any premier football club or player,\" he added on his unverified account, @ZenGrifter. Read more: Footballers 'doped by London doctor' Chelsea added they have \"never used the services of Dr Bonar and have no knowledge or record of any of our players having been treated by him or using his services\". Leicester denied the allegations and added: \"We are extremely disappointed that The Sunday Times has published unsubstantiated allegations referring to players from clubs including Leicester City when, on its own admission, it has insufficient evidence to support the claims.\" Championship side Birmingham City said: \"The club have not used the services of Mark Bonar and has no knowledge or record of any of our players, past or present, doing so.\" The Sunday Times says it has secretly filmed Bonar claiming he has prescribed drugs such as EPO, steroids and human growth hormone to elite sports professionals from the UK and abroad over the past six years, including:. The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies. Bonar had his professional services agreement with the Omniya Clinic terminated on Friday, after it emerged he does not have a licence to practise medicine in the UK. The Football Association released a statement regarding the claims, saying: \"These are very serious allegations. As such, The FA welcomes UK Anti-Doping's decision to immediately launch an independent review into the matters raised by the Sunday Times. \"The FA is fully committed to maintaining the integrity of English football and will work with Ukad and other relevant agencies in seeking to do so. The FA urges anyone with information that may be relevant to come forward as soon as possible.\" The case is now the subject of a government investigation, following claims made by a whistleblower athlete who was banned for breaching anti-doping rules in 2014. According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the organisation was \"deeply concerned and shocked by the allegations\" and it would conduct an independent review into the case. World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live it was \"pretty dreadful news\" and backed calls for an inquiry, but added: \"It is best to wait for Ukad to do their own investigation, then we have full knowledge of the facts to work with. \"My own guess is if they had sufficient evidence then they would have acted.\" Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Like all large events, there is a certain risk involved, so we are well prepared,\" Berlin police spokesman Stefan Redlich told Reuters news agency. \"We searched the Olympic stadium with dogs trained to sniff out explosives before we let the fans in.

Ministers agreed they needed \"to do more to push our most able students\" and were introducing changes to raise standards \"for all our young people\". The Welsh Assembly's Children, Young People and Education Committee was quizzing Estyn about its annual report, on Wednesday. Mr Rowlands said that schools focused on a performance measure which requires pupils to get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English or Welsh and maths. That, he said, encouraged schools to focus on the borderline between C and D grades \"and possibly not giving enough support for those who could get As and A*s\". But he said that evidence from primary schools, further education and the PISA international tests also suggested that able and talented pupils were not given enough support in the education system. \"I don't think schools and the education system more generally have done enough,\" he said. Claire Morgan, Strategic Director for Estyn, said the focus on particular performance indicators meant there is \"some gaming, [and] early entry that hasn't helped to stretch the more able\". \"I think this has stifled the progress of more able learners,\" she added. A Welsh Government spokesman said ministers recognised \"we need to do more to push our most able students to reach their full potential\". \"Through programmes such as the Seren Network, we are already supporting our brightest students to reach our leading universities. The spokesman said changes were being introduced to the system used to measure schools' performance for 15 to 16 year olds, following a review of qualifications for 14 to 19 year olds.

    "source": "The 26-year-old had explored options with Williams and Renault but said on Sunday he was \"happy and proud\" to be with Force India. He added: \"I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong.\" Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers. Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari are all retaining the same line-ups as this year and McLaren are promoting their reserve driver in Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne to partner two-time champion Fernando Alonso in 2017. Alonso's current team-mate Jenson Button has decided not to race next year. The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was \"quite possible\" he would not race in F1 again. Renault have long been expected to promote their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon into one of their cars next season, with both current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer under pressure for their seats. But Renault have not yet made their decision and are taking their time. The lack of availability of other drivers means either Magnussen or Palmer may be retained, although that is not believed to be Renault's first choice.",

    "source": "Mark King, 21, earlier admitted stabbing 37-year-old Steven Downes in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow at 01:30 on 17 January 2015. He was told he would also be supervised for three years after his release. King is already serving four-and-a-half years for another stabbing carried out in July 2015 while he was on bail. For that offence he was also ordered to be supervised in the community for two years following his release. The court heard that in the January attack, Mr Downes had been stabbed in the back, face, arm and side and had suffered a punctured lung. Judge Lord Clark highlighted the \"pattern of knife-carrying\" King was developing and told him a substantial prison term was the only appropriate sentence. King was assessed as being at \"maximum risk\" of re-offending or causing harm to the public. During his evidence, Mr Downes said he had asked King and his friends in the close to keep the noise down because his children were sleeping. King, who was armed with a knife, ran up the stairs towards him. Mr Downes said: \"I think I got stabbed when I got dragged out of my house with my jumper over my head. \"A group were kicking my door open and bottles were getting flung. \"I blacked out and ended up in the Western Infirmary suffering from a punctured lung.\" Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, Lord Clark told King he had been convicted of assaulting Mr Downes to his severe injury to the danger of his life and of attempting to murder him. \"You tried to force entry to Steven Downes' flat. The door was kicked open and Steven Downes was dragged out of the flat and struck on the head and stabbed,\" he said. \"He had a stab wound to his back, stab wounds to his face and arm and a stab wound to the left side resulting in a collapsed lung and bleeding into his chest cavity. \"The injury to his left arm required to be stapled, the injury to his back was life-threatening and other injuries have resulted in permanent scarring.\" He added:  \"Your repeated involvement in offences involving knives is a very serious matter. \"The report notes you are beginning to develop a pattern of knife-carrying which is assessed as representing an increased risk to local communities. \"I see no alternative to a substantial custodial sentence.\" He warned King that any breach of the licence conditions could see him taken back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. Matt Jackson, defending, revealed his client had been convicted of assault to severe injury and danger of life, along with other offences, and was on High Court bail when he committed the crimes. Mr Jackson said King had been \"a young lad with terrific prospects\" before he turned to offending while out of work. \"Every once in a while in one's professional career one encounters an individual [whom] its baffling to understand how he's involved in and is convicted of these very serious offences.",

Avon has been in France for almost 50 years. It employs about 120 staff in Paris, supporting 11,000 representatives who visit customers in their own homes. Angry workers in France have accused Avon of keeping them in the dark for months and not acting in line with Avon's publically stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of \"open and candid communication\". Estelle Croissant, an Avon employee responsible for supporting the direct selling representatives, told the BBC that a workers' council representing Avon staff in France was challenging the company for not following the correct redundancy process. \"They have not respected all the processes according to their own rules and values,\" she said. \"We now know an administrator has been in place since May this year, but no scheme to assist the workers is yet in place. We just feel abandoned. \"We knew that the business was not good, but we have all been very committed and worked relentlessly over many months to help the company to try and become profitable.\" Further meetings are taking place between workers' representatives and the management. Avon is one of the world's largest beauty companies and sells most of its products through direct selling by self-employed representatives who visit customers in their homes. The US parent company has been through a string of reorganisations and management changes. Two years ago, it turned down a takeover offer from rival cosmetic company Coty.

The pair discussed the possibility, which Marr said would \"make a hell of a lot of people very happy\". But \"the distrust remained\" between the two and the idea never came to pass. Marr was back in touch with Morrissey in a \"rare period of communication\" when he was remastering The Smiths' back catalogue and they arranged to meet in a pub in south Manchester. \"I was happy to see him,\" he wrote. \"It was 10 years or more since we'd last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit.\" But then the conversation turned to \"deeper things\" and, eventually, what Marr called \"that subject\". He wrote: \"There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. \"Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great.\" After parting company with a hug, Marr returned to his band at the time, The Cribs, and talked to them about him possibly playing some shows with The Smiths, which he hoped \"might even be better than before\". But by the time he returned from Mexico with the Cribs, Marr said, the communication had ended. \"Things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be,\" he said. \"An air of disaffection and distrust remained between us.

    "source": "What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office. The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office. For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. \"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments:. This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester. I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge. I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon. I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow. I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford. I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset. I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley. I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

Leicester's Tom Youngs had said the proposal \"fills players with dread\". The RPA has now said a shortened two-month off-season will be \"seriously detrimental to player welfare\". Premiership Rugby has previously said the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become \"more sophisticated\" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But an RPA statement on Monday read: \"The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL. \"Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads they face. \"The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated.\" England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs. \"Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players,\" the statement continued. \"If the Premiership season retains its current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11-month season for these players. \"This cannot be avoided unless these players start their domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension.\"",

    "source": "Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate. \"We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,\" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News. Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. In March, another human rights organisation,. Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases. of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes. It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as \"deeply disappointing\". The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports. In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes. In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims. What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation. \"Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,\" he said. Source: Nato. \"They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling. \"I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections.\" Nato says it is ready to co-operate with the new Libyan authorities in assessing what further action is appropriate. But so far the task force being set up in Tripoli seems to have made little headway, our diplomatic correspondent adds.",

Pedrique said it was a humanitarian issue, not a political one. The baseball coach appealed to the team owners in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) to support his call \"out of respect for the Venezuelans who are sacrificing their lives for the freedom of this country, for the benefit of all\". Baseball is Venezuela's most popular sport - outdoing football, unlike many of its neighbours in South America. The call comes days after Venezuela lost the right to host the 2018 Caribbean Series tournament, which will now be played in Mexico instead. Tournament organisers did not specify a reason, but Venezuela has been hit by consistent political instability and street protests for months, which have led to dozens of deaths. Angry demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro, which have taken place on an almost daily basis since April, show no sign of abating. The opposition claims Mr Maduro's government has severely damaged the country's economy, and is calling for early elections. The government has blamed the opposition for the violence at the protests saying it uses teenagers and children as \"cannon fodder\".",

    "source": "The European Space Agency astronaut arrived at the orbiting space lab on Monday, along with two crewmates from Russia and America. But what exactly will she be doing during her time in space? The ISS gives the chance to do scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth, as the station offers an environment of microgravity. Here we run through a few examples of the experiments on Samantha's 'to do' list... Samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator, which can heat metals to 2,000\u00c2\u00b0C and then cool them very quickly. This will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid, without the effect of the Earth's gravity. It's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work. Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it doesn't float away. The testing will also see what impact this has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body. For example, she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out. Samantha will record what she eats and her energy levels over a period of time. Other things that will be looked at include how space affects skin and why many astronauts get headaches.",

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\". He said: \"Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype. \"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. \"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\". Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: \"Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.\"",

Reuben Lewis from Llanidloes was driven 45 minutes from Ysgol Cedewain, Newtown, without teachers or transport staff realising he was still on board. BBC Wales understands he was then left alone on the parked bus in Rhayader on two separate occasions. Powys council said there had been a \"serious breakdown in communication\". A spokesman added it had spoken to the school and all contractors to ensure immediate safeguards were put in place to prevent any similar incidents in future. The most recent incident was on Monday, when it was only noticed Reuben was missing after his sister spotted he was not present at a school swimming lesson she was teaching at Maldwyn Leisure Centre in Newtown. Police were told and Reuben was found at the Simon Price Cars bus depot. Reuben's father, Rob Lewis, said there had been \"several mistakes\" by the school and transport provider in the past year. He said Reuben was left on the bus in May last year and left at school the following December. \"I was in total and utter shock that this had happened again,\" he said. \"I'm always happy to give someone a second chance, but now I wish I'd never given them a first chance. This beggars belief. \"It was sheer luck that it was noticed Reuben was missing on Monday because his older sister works part time as a lifeguard in the leisure centre. \"She knew her brother was meant to be at the swimming lessons and when she couldn't see him she rang her mother and we alerted the school and the police.\" Mr Lewis said he had an agreement with the school to notify them before 09:00 if Reuben would not be attending, so the alarm would be raised if he was not there. \"So how could this happen again on Monday, after we were given so many reassurances?\" he added. Simon Price, owner of Simon Price Cars, said the company was contractually unable to comment while the investigation was ongoing. A council spokesman added: \"Although we have undertaken an internal review of the circumstances surrounding this incident we have advised the parents to make a formal complaint so that we can investigate all of the circumstances in the fullest detail as a matter of urgency. \"We have apologised to the parents.\"",

Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses. Seven people have been saved so far. Thousands of people have fled the area. The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says many of the bodies being pulled from the mud are those of children who were playing in the streets when the landslide hit. The scar of the collapsed hillside can be seen from miles away, he adds. The landslide hit the La Gabriela district of Bello, Antioquia province, at about 1900 GMT on Sunday. In pictures: Colombia landslide. Officials originally feared that 145 people may have been buried. But the mayor of Bello, Oscar Andres Perez, told Colombian radio 123 people had been trapped. He said the hill had become increasingly saturated with water over the past few days and that there had been a \"high risk of landslides\". Mr Perez said the authorities had warned residents of the danger. Orfanely Madrigal, a Bello resident, told a local radio station she had been aware of the risk: \"I foresaw this tragedy. I told my mother this was a high-risk area but nobody believed me.\" \"I've lost half my family - my mother, four brothers, nephews and my 13- and 10-year-old daughters,\" she said. Several hundred people, including Red Cross rescue workers, soldiers and police, are digging through the deep mud in an effort to find survivors. More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in. However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud. Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide. Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there. Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue. \"Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing,\" he said. Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding. Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there. President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes. The May-November rainy season in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America has been severe this year. The extreme weather is attributed to the La Nina climatic phenomenon, which is caused by colder than usual water currents along the Pacific coast.",

The country has become part of me.\" Having been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24. By 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said. Two months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum. \"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\" McKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days. The journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before. A night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change. His time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on. \"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear. \"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\" McKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger. Instead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said. \"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\" In Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said. It is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began. \"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get. \"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\" McKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents. \"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me. \"Two days later they offered me the job.\" McKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue. \"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone. \"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\" The Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained. That was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said. Sierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\" Sierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September. With a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game. Sierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.' McKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier. \"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\" McKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy. In the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock. The boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\" Watch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.",

Brexit and Northern Ireland's political stalemate are among the challenges waiting for the new taoiseach. The leadership contest will begin on Thursday, with the new leader to be announced on 2 June after an electoral college of the parliamentary party. County councillors and party members will also have their say. While the field may widen before 2 June, the early favourites for the post are Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Housing Minister Simon Coveney. Born in Dublin, the 38-year-old is the son of a Mumbai-born doctor and a mother from County Waterford. He was privately educated and studied medicine at Trinity College in Dublin, qualifying as a GP before entering politics. He was elected to parliament in 2007 as a representative for Dublin West and held the tourism and health portfolios before taking on his current post last year. In an RT\u00c9 interview in 2015, he revealed that he is gay, explaining that he wanted to be clear on the matter ahead of the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage. \"I just kind of want to be honest with people,\" he said. \"I don't want anyone to think that I have a hidden agenda.\" Mr Varadkar has courted controversy by announcing that people convicted of welfare fraud will be \"named and shamed\" on a government website. In a recent speech reported by the Irish Independent, he outlined his attitude to Brexit, saying there should be \"no economic border at all between north and south\". The son of the former Fine Gael politician Hugh Coveney, the Cork-born 44-year-old has followed his father's footsteps to a seat in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament). As a teenager, he was expelled from the exclusive Clongowes Wood boarding school for drinking and bunking off to attend a beach party. In a candid interview with RT\u00c9, he said he had suffered from a stutter, and lived in the shadow of his more promising brother, who is now a successful businessman. He went on to study management at the Royal Agricultural College in Gloucestershire, England, before his election as the youngest member of the D\u00e1il in 1998. He was appointed as agriculture minister in 2011 and responsibility for defence was added to his portfolio three years later. He has made no secret of his desire to lead his party - when RT\u00c9 asked the question about his intentions, he said: \"I am very ambitious, so the straight answer is yes, some day. \"But I am personally very loyal to Enda and he knows that.\"",

    "source": "Yanis Varoufakis last week confirmed that he worked on a contingency plan in case emergency funding to the Greek financial system was cut off. He has been accused of secretly planning a Greek exit from the euro. But Mr Tsipras said on Friday that he had ordered the plan, adding it would have been \"irresponsible\" not to do so. \"Of course I issued personal instructions to the finance minister to create a team that would work on a plan of defence in the event of a national emergency,'' Mr Tsipras told parliament, according to AP. \"It would have been politically naive... not to do so. Does that mean... that I was seeking an emergency?\" he asked. Mr Tsipras did not directly address the reported details of the plan, which was to have allowed the government to introduce a parallel payment system if the banking system was closed down and the drachma had to be re-introduced. A small team in the governing Syriza party was charged with investigating how to secretly copy online tax codes and use them to issue new pin numbers for every taxpayer, to be used in transactions with the state. \"That would have created a parallel banking system while the banks were shut as a result of the ECB's aggressive action to deny us some breathing space,\" Mr Varoufakis said in a leaked phone conversation. Mr Varoufakis later confirmed the existence of the plan, but denied claims that he had wanted to engineer a Greek exit from the euro. Earlier this month eurozone leaders agreed to offer Greece a third bailout of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn, after marathon talks in Brussels. However the details of the bailout remain to be negotiated between Greece and its creditors.",

    "source": "The week-long pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo Bay will largely focus on issues of secrecy. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the attacks while the others are implicated for providing support for the co-ordinated hijacking. In May, a chaotic hearing in the case lasted 13 hours. During that hearing, which formally charged the five men, the defendants made defiant outbursts and refused to answer the judge's questions or use the translation system. In addition to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Waleed bin Attash are being prosecuted in a special military tribunal for wartime offences known as a military commission. They are charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda, terrorism, and one count of murder for each known victim of the 11 September attacks at the time the charges were filed - 2,976 in total. The five face a possible death penalty sentence if convicted. CIA waterboarding tapes revealed. On Monday, the defendants listened calmly and answered the judge's questions, although Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said: \"I don't think there's any justice in this court.\" Defence lawyers argued during the hearing that their clients should not be forced to attend the rest of the week's hearings, because the forcible transport from their high-security cells may remind them of their time at secret CIA prisons. Before their transfer to the US base at Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the defendants were held for years in secret CIA prisons. All five have said they were tortured during interrogations. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was repeatedly water-boarded before being brought to Guantanamo. \"We have to talk about torture,\" Air Force Captain Michael Schwartz, a defence lawyer, said on Monday. But Judge James Pohl said the issue was not relevant at this stage. Prosecution lawyers have said the use of waterboarding and similar methods could be relevant when determining whether prisoners' statements were voluntarily given. The court is also expected to hear a defence request to abolish what they term a \"presumptive classification\" that treats any discussion of the CIA prisons as top secret, as well as a media request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions. Judge Pohl ultimately ruled that the defendants would not be forced to attend hearings scheduled to run through the end of this week, but did not rule out further pre-trial hearings. He said all would have to be present for their trial, which is not likely to start for more than a year.",

Scientists say the finding is \"encouraging\" and could eventually lead to new drugs to help people live longer and healthier lives. Lithium is used in psychiatry to help stop mood swings but has a risk of serious side-effects at high doses. How lithium acts on the brain is not fully understood, but in fruit flies the drug seems to extend life by blocking a chemical known as GSK-3. \"The response we've seen in flies to low doses of lithium is very encouraging and our next step is to look at targeting GSK-3 in more complex animals with the aim of eventually developing a drug regime to test in humans,\" said Prof Linda Partridge of the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, who led the study. The research, published in Cell Reports, found fruit flies lived 16% longer than average when given low doses of lithium. At high doses, lithium reduced their lifespan. \"We found low doses not only prolong life but also shield the body from stress and block fat production for flies on a high sugar diet,\" said co-researcher Dr Ivana Bjedov from the UCL Cancer Institute. Claire Bale of the charity Parkinson's UK, which part-funded the study, said: \"It's encouraging to see that the researchers have been able to identify a key piece of the ageing puzzle, which one day may allow us to intervene in the ageing process.\" \"This research has the potential to not only help create a healthier older generation, but also provide significant insights into how we could potentially treat or even prevent conditions of ageing like Parkinson's.\" Lithium salts have been used in the past as a health tonic and to heal conditions such as gout and migraines. In modern medicine, lithium is used to encourage mood stability in bipolar disorder and is also being considered for the treatment of memory impairment. It has a risk of serious side-effects at high doses.",

    "source": "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger. Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue. \"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\" While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth. \"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission. \"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\" \"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\" Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet. \"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make. \"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\" Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii. \"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\" He added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating. \"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\" The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

    "source": "Mr Trump said they did not discuss his plan to make Mexico pay for the wall - a central plank of his campaign. But Mr Pena Nieto later tweeted: \"I made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall.\" After the meeting, Mr Trump flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver a key speech on tackling illegal immigration. At their joint press conference in Mexico City, Mr Pena Nieto said Mexicans had been hurt by some of Mr Trump's previous comments but he believed he now genuinely wanted to build relations. The New York businessman called Mexicans \"amazing\" and \"spectacular\" people, in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers\". Forcing Mexico to pay for a wall has become a rallying cry among his supporters. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton said not bringing it up was a sign of cowardice. \"It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it,\" she tweeted. Mexicans tell Trump: 'You're not welcome!' Donald Trump's Hispanic voter 'doomsday' 'Me gustan los tacos!': A Spanish phrasebook for Trump's visit. The Republican has seen his poll ratings slip since the party conventions last month. Both nationally and in key states, he trails Hillary Clinton, who enjoys particularly strong support among minorities. Donald Trump has called Mexico an enemy of the US, but on Wednesday he said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was his friend. That contrast illustrates how different Diplomatic Donald was from the firebrand candidate who tore through the Republican primaries by flogging his opponents for being soft on illegal immigration and border security. If the goal of Mr Trump's visit to Mexico City was to represent his nation on the world stage without the kind of embarrassment or controversy that Hillary Clinton warns would be certain if he is elected, then his last-minute trip was a success. But his surprise appearance south of the border may come with a price. It is likely to make it more difficult for him to back away from hard-line immigration positions that are unpopular among moderate voters. Perhaps more grating for Mr Trump's diehard supporters is that he had the chance to confront the Mexican leader and instead spoke of protecting \"hemispheric manufacturing\" and avoided the subject of who would pay for the border wall. Diplomatic Donald may not be the candidate they thought they were getting. Mr Trump said his words to Mr Pena Nieto had been strong and straightforward. He tried to put behind him his previous comments on Mexicans by saying those in the US had made a \"great contribution\". \"I have a great feeling for Mexicans. They are amazing people,\" he said. Mr Trump said he had employed many Mexicans and that they were \"spectacular people with strong values of faith and community\". He went on to list five points he had set out in his talks:. Mr Trump said: \"We recognise and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders.\" But he said there was no discussion on who would pay for the wall. He had earlier threatened to stop cash earned by Mexicans based in the US being sent home until the country paid for it to be built. Mr Trump concluded by saying he was honoured by Mr Pena Nieto's invitation to visit, adding: \"I call you a friend.\" Mr Pena Nieto accepted there were border challenges but pointed out the massive contribution Mexicans have made to the US, and that \"six million jobs rely on exports to Mexico\". He said: \"My priority is to protect Mexicans wherever they may be. Mexicans in the US are honest people, hard-working people who respect their families, their community and the law. They deserve everybody's respect.\" Mr Pena Nieto has invited both US candidates to visit, but has faced criticism at home over Mr Trump. Ex-President Vicente Fox earlier told CNN: \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit.\" Former First Lady Margarita Zavala tweeted: \"We Mexicans have dignity, and we reject your hate speech.\" At least two demonstrations have been planned in Mexico City. Mexicans tell Donald Trump: 'You are not welcome' What Trump has said about Mexico. \"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\" - May 2015. Mexico is \"ripping off the US more than almost any other nation\" - February 2015. \"Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States\" - from his immigration plan. ...and what Mexico has said about Trump. President Pena Nieto spoke out against Mr Trump's \"strident rhetoric\" in March, adding: \"That's how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.\" His predecessor, Felipe Calderon, insisted: \"Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall.\" After Mr Trump vowed to reclaim all remittances derived from illegal wages, Mr Calderon's predecessor Vicente Fox, told the BBC: \"Is Trump going to steal the money? How can any human being think like that? It's incredible.\"",

    "source": "But with the Foxes now languishing near the foot of the table and one hotelier claiming the impact of Richard III is slowly wearing off, is the journey over? Or is it a case of what next? Even the most upbeat of Leicester fans would probably find it difficult to be positive about their Premier League title defence as the stats make for pretty grim reading - played 19, won five, drawn five and lost nine. To put that in some context, City lost just three times in the league last season. However, Claudio Ranieri's side are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will meet Sevilla for a place in the quarter finals. And after that, only the small matter of European giants such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona would stand in the way of European glory... Season ticket holder Sam Webster remains quietly confident, but does not think the Foxes can go all the way in Europe. He said: \"We are an unknown entity, and the bigger teams are definitely underestimating us like the big fish did in the Premier League last season. \"Getting to the semis would be remarkable. However, the drastic difference between the Champions League and Premier League form is unacceptable.\" But even if the Foxes are not quite living up to expectations on the pitch, Richard III has helped keep the city buzzing. Amy Gray, head of tourism affairs at VisitBritain, said: \"Money can't buy the publicity - the sort of publicity Leicester has got. \"We saw a 17% increase in international visitors to the East Midlands for April to June. \"What we've seen in Leicester is a fantastic heritage story and a fantastic sports story - and we know both are a fantastic draw to international visitors.\" Source: Leicester Cathedral. Eloic Montagnier, general manager of Leicester's Belmont Hotel, believes interest in other Leicester destinations - such as the National Space Centre after Tim Peake's expedition - has also contributed to the city's success. He said: \"We have done over 80% [occupancy] for the last year. \"It was fantastic in November, with 85% occupancy for the month - it was 65% two years ago. \"I think this is a great opportunity to grow the city and I think it will keep going - I don't see the success dropping off any time soon. \"Football has brought a lot of people in who may never have even considered coming to Leicester.\" But others aren't quite so bullish about the future. Vito Ferro's San Carlo restaurant has become something of a tourist hotspot after it held a celebratory meal for the Leicester City players the day after the title was won. Despite an initial surge in bookings, Mr Ferro believes it will wear off eventually. \"It is too soon to say [whether things will quieten down] because they are in the Champions League,\" he said. \"But I would say, yes, things are eventually going to quieten down unless something else happens.\" So, as Leicester looks ahead to 2017, will good things come in threes with Champions League glory for the Foxes? Or will the city simply have to accept that \"two out of three ain't bad\"? Source: Ernst and Young.",

    "source": "The former Liverpool, Swansea City, Reading and Watford boss has signed a 12-month rolling contract to replace Ronny Deila, who departed the Scottish champions at the end of the season. Rodgers, 43, left Anfield in October after more than three years in charge. \"I will give everything I have and do all I can to bring our supporters exciting, entertaining and winning football,\" said the Northern Irishman. Rodgers can give Celtic hope - Sutton. \"The club has been in magnificent shape in recent years and has collected silverware regularly during this time. \"My objective now, of course, is to continue this work, to keep us at the top and again make our mark in Europe.\" Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Celtic's largest individual shareholder Dermot Desmond described Rodgers as \"a great manager\", adding that the Scottish Premiership club had interviewed \"in excess of six\" candidates,. It also emerged that Rodgers met club representatives for several hours on Wednesday. \"Brendan is a highly-sought after manager and we are pleased we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic,\" said chief executive Peter Lawwell. \"I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. \"We wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters - we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. \"We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. Rodgers moved into management with Watford and subsequently had a spell in charge of Reading before leading Swansea City to promotion to the Premier League. A switch to Liverpool followed and Rodgers came close to the title in 2013-2014, finishing two points behind Manchester City. However, he left Anfield without winning a trophy. Rodgers will come up against Rangers manager Mark Warburton next season, with the two men having worked together on the coaching staff at Watford. \"He's very experienced, well organised, a good motivator, a good man-manager,\" Warburton said this week. \"He's a manager of the highest quality.\" John Hartson, a former Celtic striker is also a fan of Rodgers and believes his appointment will be warmly greeted by the Celtic supporters. \"I think they've got themselves a proper manager of the highest regard,\" the former Wales international said. \"I think he'll do very, very well. It's a great opportunity for Brendan and I think the fans will embrace his appointment. \" 'Rodgers has to not pretend to reinvent football as he did at Liverpool' Former Celtic manager John Barnes is not surprised that the club have managed to lure Rodgers. \"He will not view it as a step down, despite what others will think,\" he said. \"Celtic is a huge club. They are in the Champions League and I'm sure Brendan would want to pit his wits against the big sides there. \"The fans can expect a very exciting brand of football. In terms of playing the Celtic way, they couldn't pick a better man for the job.\" BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson. \"For Celtic, the most comparable spell has been Rodgers' time at Swansea - an aspirational club, with a well-defined budget, and a sense of momentum. \"The Northern Irishman embraced the club's past, but also redefined its horizons, taking them into the Premier League and then to 11th place. \"He signed shrewdly, seeking talented players who had not been coveted by larger clubs or were not yet ready for that stage, and moulding them into a side that played attractive, engaging and artful football.\" 'Rodgers' Swansea model can be a success at Celtic'",

    "source": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller's brace and Joe Dodoo's third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners-up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating them from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes's men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested they would live up to their billing as they pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. It was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as they squared up to each other. For all its lack of free-flowing football, it was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite their lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that his players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see his side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but they showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left-back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, it is mostly down to the hard work of their impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full-backs. Hayes skipped past two on his way to the box but Graeme Shinnie's hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and his trickery was feeding Rooney but his fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt-edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering their defences. For all their efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored his 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for himself in the box and when his shot was saved, 37-year-old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose themselves before Miller made it two when he skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played his part in that second goal and he slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief. Those who remained in defiance almost witnessed a Miller hat-trick as he followed up on Dodoo's shot that came back off the crossbar but defender Andrew Considine spared further blushes as he cleared off the line.

It was a much improved performance from Murray, who broke 10th seed Raonic's serve five times. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Roger Federer 6-3 2-6 7-5, and fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils beat Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-4. \"It's the most challenging surface for me every year,\" said Murray. \"It normally takes me a few weeks to remember what I need to do, how to move, the way to build up the points and making sure you don't rush.\" Murray needed almost three hours to beat Benoit Paire on Thursday and had struggled for form since the Australian Open in January - but he was close to his best against Raonic. The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. \"The two most important shots in tennis I did really well,\" added Murray. \"I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. \"The serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and I'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches.\" Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals. The pair beat sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea 6-2 6-3, despite Murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage. Murray leads Marcelo Melo by just five points in the rankings and will face the Brazilian, and partner Ivan Dodig of Croatia, in the last four on Saturday.

It is one of the earliest tropical systems to form in the Atlantic Hurricane Basin since records began. Meanwhile, another tropical storm, Pali, has formed over the Pacific, similarly rare at this time of year. Scientists have linked the storms to powerful winds and high sea surface temperatures resulting from an unusually strong El Nino phenomenon this year. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has said the 2015 occurrence of El Nino will be among the three strongest recorded since 1950. Severe droughts and significant flooding in many parts of the world are being attributed to the phenomenon, which occurs every two to seven years.

Speaking in Germany last month, Mr Johnson told the BBC: \"You have got to engage with Russia, but you have got to engage in a very guarded way. You have got to beware of what they are up to. \"There is no question that, when you look at Russian activity on the cyber front, when you look at what they are doing in the western Balkans, when you look at what has been happening in the Ukraine, you've got to be very, very cautious. \"I think it is entirely right to have a dual track approach.

In March, fraud prevention service Cifas said that digitally-savvy young adults were increasingly becoming targets, at fraud hotspots in London, Leicester, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow. Now, Experian has said that identity theft has become the most prevalent form of fraud for the first time since the recession. The victims in one in six of these cases were young tenants, it said. Wealthy couples were next on the list of victims, with this group particularly targeted in card and loan fraud. \"[The findings] highlight the need for people to think about how they protect their personal information both on and off line,\" said Nick Mothershaw, of Experian.

Finances became a concern when a planned \u00a37.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  \"The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. \"We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable.\" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining \"high quality care for local people\" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: \"People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. \"We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.\"",

    "source": "He was speaking in a BBC interview after a Russian court declared him \"under arrest in absentia\" over the 1990s murder of a Siberian mayor. \"Definitely I'm considering asking for asylum in the UK,\" he said. Mr Putin \"sees me - it's obvious now - as a serious threat\", he said. Once Russia's richest man, the former head of the now defunct Yukos oil firm spent 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Mr Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he now lives abroad, mainly in Switzerland. \"I'm considered by President Putin as a threat, economically, because of the possible seizure of Russian assets abroad, and politically, as someone who will potentially help democratic candidates in the coming 2016 elections,\" he said. Russia will hold elections to the lower house of parliament - the State Duma - next year. The Duma is currently dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The BBC's Richard Galpin asked Mr Khodorkovsky whether he felt at risk in light of the murders of prominent opponents of Mr Putin in recent years. Among them was former secret agent Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with radioactive polonium in a London hotel in 2006. \"The history of deaths of opponents of this regime is impressive... but I was in jail for 10 years, I could have been killed any day easily. In London I feel much safer than during those years,\" he replied. When he left Russia in 2013 he said he would not get involved in politics - which was widely believed to have been the reason for his early release. He told the BBC on Wednesday that he would \"help young political activists in Russia to gain political experience and present an alternative to the existing regime\". He said it was \"far too optimistic\" to speak of regime change in Russia now, \"but I'm quite confident that within 10 years the regime will be changed and I hope I will play a significant role in that\". Earlier, referring to the Russian order for his arrest, he said the Moscow authorities had \"gone mad\". He is accused of ordering several of his employees to kill both the mayor and a businessman, who survived. Investigators allege Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, was killed on 26 June 1998 for demanding Mr Khodorkovsky's oil firm, Yukos, pay taxes that the company had allegedly been avoiding. Local businessman Yevgeny Rybin was allegedly targeted because his activities \"clashed with Yukos's interests\", Russia's powerful Investigative Committee (SK) said in a statement (in Russian). Mr Rybin survived a gun attack in November 1998 and a second attack on his car in March 1999, when another man in the vehicle was killed and several people were injured. Five people have already been tried for the attacks and the arrest warrant is unlikely to make any difference unless Mr Khodorkovsky returns to Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Armed police raided the Moscow offices of Mr Khodorkovsky's Open Russia pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, in a move that authorities said was linked to allegations of tax evasion. The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched. After Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $50bn (\u00c2\u00a332bn) in compensation. 1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers. 1987 - Founds Menatep bank. 1995 - Buys Yukos for $350m, with Menatep assuming $2bn in debt. 2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud. 2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years. 2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt. 2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering. 2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency; leaves Russia for Germany. 2015 - Charged with ordering 1990s murder of Siberian mayor; says he is considering asking for political asylum in the UK.",

The 29-year-old driver of a lorry involved in the crash was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He was released on bail to return to an east London police station on 7 December pending further inquiries. The London Cycling Campaign (LCC) group demanded an immediate redesign of the roundabout. It said the roundabout was dangerous because the cycle superhighway stopped in the middle of the Bow roundabout. LCC's chief executive Ashok Sinha said: \"We're appalled at this latest preventable death and are fearful of what may happen when large numbers of cyclists are expected to tackle this junction on their way to and from the Olympics next year. \"We can't understand how this junction can form part of what is one of the Mayor's flagship cycling projects: it must be redesigned now.\" TfL surface transport manager Leon Daniels said: \"We are extremely sorry to learn of the tragic death of a female cyclist, following a collision with an HGV on the Bow Road roundabout on Friday evening. \"Our thoughts are with her family and friends. I have visited the scene and both TfL and the police have launched inquiries which will report as quickly as possible\u00e2\u20ac\u00ac.\"  \u00c2. Last month a 58-year-old man was killed in a collision with a tipper truck. Four priority lanes for cyclists, branded cycle superhighways, have been painted blue around London, and another eight are due to open within the next four years. On Saturday, more than 300 cyclists rode through the capital in a \"Tour du Danger\" protest calling for the capital's roads to be made safer. Cycling blogger Danny Williams said: \"I think the superhighways should be made proper superhighways. \"I think it's a good idea, incredibly badly implemented and not very well thought through, and the Mayor needs to take responsibility for that. A TfL spokesman said: \"There has been an 18% fall in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured on London's roads in the last decade, compared to the TfL's baseline figures from the mid to late 1990s.\" No-one from the office of Mayor Boris Johnson was available for comment.",

Ian Cuthbertson, 49, Michael Hallett, 37, Joseph Catlin, 30, and Zena Kane, 35, of no fixed address, deny murder.

A post-mortem examination found he had substantial facial injuries and had been stabbed fifteen times in the back and in the chest. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said that Mr Catlin had been living with Mr Miller in the two months before his death and that the pair had known each other for years.

Under current EU funding programmes, due to run between 2014 and 2020, Wales receives \u00c2\u00a31.8bn in structural funds. Most of the cash is spent in north Wales, west Wales and the south Wales valleys. Mr Cairns, who backed the Remain campaign, said: \"In that perspective I think everyone has to look at the sort of European policies that were being developed by the Welsh government, but also by the UK government, that obviously didn't have that connection with the public. \"The public didn't recognise the outcomes that were coming from those policies.\" He added: \"I think the sorts of Objective One funding that we all heard of for many years, as we used to call it, hasn't really had the impact. \"And I think that all assembly members of all political parties have got to reflect on that.\" There was too much complexity and bureaucracy in the way money was spent initially, Mr Cairns said. Although EU-funded policies had become more efficient, \"ultimately they haven't connected with people and I think that we need to reflect and people need to see outcomes\", he said. \"It's not about how much money is spent to go in - it's what comes out at the end.\" David Davies, pro-Brexit Conservative MP for Monmouth, has said he will work with the Welsh Government to ensure Wales gets its fair share of the money saved by leaving the EU.

Wolves pressed late on with several corners but Brighton held on. Walter Zenga's Wolves went into the game having won just two of their past nine away league games with only one clean sheet and they conceded what turned out to be the winning goal after only 16 minutes. Full-back Bong whipped in a pinpoint cross which was headed home by Baldock for his third goal in three games as the Seagulls took control before the break. Top-scorer Glenn Murray almost doubled Brighton's lead early in the second half but his header was narrowly wide and a minute later Knockaert forced a fine save from Carl Ikeme with a long-range left-footed shot. Wolves committed men forward late on but, despite a succession of corner kicks in the dying minutes, Albion held on for victory and their eighth clean sheet in 13 games. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \"It is very timely that Sam is in this form and I am very pleased for him. He's been good for us. \"He may not score too many with his head but he showed a desire to get across the defender. \"He is a team player, works hard for the team and he is at the right place at the right time.\" Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: \"It was a good game in my opinion but they scored and we didn't.

He began providing them in July after two other suppliers went bust, but has said he has only received one payment. Coperforma said all contractors were paid in full for services received. \"In line with our contractual policy we do not discuss with third parties details of the relationship we have with individual transport service providers,\" a spokesman said. More news from Sussex. Mr Robins, of UK Ambulance Sales, said he lost almost \u00c2\u00a3200,000 in the summer after two patient transport companies in Sussex went bust. Coperforma stepped in to keep the service running and, he said, did a deal with him to lease ambulances for six months from 1 July. \"They made payments for 1 July, supposed to be a six-month basis, [and] haven't made payment since. \"Invoiced them for the full amount. Nothing at all, so I feel quite aggrieved about what's gone on,\" Mr Robins said. Not for the first time Coperforma are having to deal with disgruntled contractors. We saw it with VM Langfords, Docklands Medical Services, Dedicated Care in Eastbourne and now UK Ambulance Sales. As the \"managed\" handover between Coperforma and South Central Ambulance Service begins, so people within the industry are telling me that confidence in the service and in Coperforma is fragile. Indeed, \"fragile\" is how the boss of the Clinical Commissioning Group, Wendy Carberry, described the entire Sussex Patient Transport Service when I interviewed her this week. It might be  that fragility leads to more problems in the months to come. The spokesman for Coperforma said: \"I can categorically state that our payments to our contractors are up to date for service received to support the Sussex patient transport service. \"I can also confirm that we are in different stages of negotiations with a small number of providers over invoice queries which we are trying to resolve as speedily as possible.\" Coperforma is due to hand over its patient transport service for Sussex in a \"managed transition\" to South Central Ambulance Service by next April.",

The Swindon-based WBO European super-middleweight title holder, who was overheard threatening to \"knock out\" Ms Gribovskaja, had denied assault. But he was found guilty after a trial at Croydon Magistrates' Court. The victim was awoken in the early hours of the morning by Cox forcing his way into her flat, the court heard. She called 999 before he broke through her bedroom door. The 29-year-old boxer, who appeared in court under his real name Jamie Russan, was convicted of assault by beating, violence to secure entry, harassment and criminal damage. Alex Slater, prosecuting, said: \"Viktoria said she had never been so scared in her life. She thought he was going to kill her.\" He was heard in a recording of a 999 call, which lasted 21 minutes, to say: \"I will knock you spark out.\" At his trial last month, Cox said he had \"barged\" through Ms Gribovskaja's front and bedroom doors because he feared she \"could kill herself\". He denied putting his hands on her. But magistrates found the victim's account of the confrontation \"credible and convincing\". Nathaniel Ikeazor, representing Cox, told the court the boxer regretted the incident. He said: \"Jamie is remorseful as to how his actions affected Viktoria and affected the relationship thereafter.\" Cox was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison for the assault and harassment charges, 20 weeks for violence to secure entry and 12 weeks for criminal damage, to run concurrently. He was ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a31,105 in compensation to his victim and court costs, and given a restraining order barring him from contacting her indefinitely. Cox showed no emotion as the sentence was handed down. Speaking outside court, his trainer of 10 years, John Costello, said his legal team will appeal against the decision and are \"confident he will clear his name\". Cox will be suspended from boxing for the duration of his sentence, Mr Costello confirmed.",

Items believed to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a310m were taken in the raid at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London's jewellery quarter. More than 70 safety deposit boxes were ransacked. Perkins, of Heene Road, Enfield, Collins, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Jones, of Park Avenue, Enfield and Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, were arrested in May. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle, namely to enter Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London with intent to steal, between 1 January and 7 April. The four men also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, but the prosecution said they would not pursue the charge in light of the men's guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle charge. Earlier this month a law firm confirmed the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit had gone into liquidation as the company was insolvent and \"owes money to companies and people\". The men will be sentenced at a date to be confirmed. After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response. The force apologised for not following procedures and said it would investigate why the call was given a grade that meant no police response was deemed necessary. Five other men still face trial accused of conspiring to commit the burglary, a charge they deny. Hugh Doyle, 48, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield, north London; William Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, east London; and John Harbinson, 42, of Beresford Gardens, Benfleet, Essex, all also deny the laundering offence and are due to stand trial in November.

    "source": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow. US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow. But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign. US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election. Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man. So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a \"Good Morning, y'all\" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany. So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth. \"Good try,\" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond. He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work. And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week. Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job. He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments. \"As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,\" he said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region. Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014. Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where \"terrorism has put down roots\". However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago. Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions. Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to \"restore co-operation with the Pentagon\". \"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,\" he told reporters. The defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was \"little doubt\" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections.",

The developer St Modwen appealed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Greg Clark, who has rejected the plan. The company said it was disappointed and is considering its options. The Melton Fields project would have consisted of 510 houses and a care home. The company also applied for permission for an alternative smaller scheme of 390 homes. Villagers mounted a campaign against the development, with more than 1,200 people writing letters objecting to the plans. East Riding council rejected both proposals claiming the land had been earmarked for employment rather than residential use. The developer appealed against the council's decision to the government's Planning Inspectorate, which held a public inquiry last year. Councillor John Mabbett, vice chairman of North Ferriby Parish Council, described the secretary of state's refusal as \"a victory for common sense\". \"Had this ill-conceived development been approved our community would have been overwhelmed by its size and the fabric and character of the village would have been harmed for ever,\" he said.

    "source": "The operation took four hours. IS continued to fire mortars at the airport from further inside the city after losing the ground to the army. The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. Thursday's advance brings the army within less than a mile (1.6km) of western Mosul, where the militants are expected to launch attacks from densely populated neighbourhoods. After darkness fell, government armour could be seen lining up for a new move forward, the BBC's Quentin Sommerville reports from the scene. Thursday's assault began with air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told the Associated Press news agency, without specifying their nationality. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS but our correspondent, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It is a large piece of land and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city. Aram Shakaram, the country deputy director for Save the Children in Iraq, told the BBC he believed relatively few people had been able to escape the city since Wednesday. He said the charity believed that nearly 800,000 people were still trapped there. We are very scared, and we are worried that the final stages are going to take long. S will not give up and withdraw that easily and the whole operation might take as long as it did in east Mosul. I won't lie, I am scared too and I don't know if I am going to die in an air strike or killed by an IS fighter. Voices from West Mosul: 'Everyone is scared' More than 160,000 people have fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. All bridges linking the east and west of the city, across the Tigris river, have been destroyed by air strikes. IS jihadists overran Mosul as they spread across much of northern and western Iraq in 2014.",

    "source": "Israel made \"substantial efforts\" to avoid civilian deaths, it said. The militant group Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, called the Israeli report worthless. It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time. The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. \"This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,\" the report said. \"Harm to the civilian population... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,\" it added. \"Israel did not intend, and deeply regrets, the harm caused to the Palestinian civilian population and surroundings during the 2014 Gaza Conflict.\" A spokesman for Hamas said the Israeli report was \"valueless\". \"Israeli war crimes are clear because they were committed in front of live cameras,\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. Meanwhile, a report from the UN Human Rights Council on the war is also expected to be published this week. The council says its inquiry will cover \"all violations of international humanitarian law\" committed by both sides during the Gaza conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday: \"Whoever wants a baseless, automatic accusation against Israel can waste their time reading the UN report.\" In April, a UN inquiry said that at least 44 Palestinians had been killed by \"Israeli actions\" while sheltering at seven UN schools during the war. The inquiry also found that three empty UN schools were used by Palestinian militants to store weapons, and that in two cases they likely fired from them.",

It was a memorable win for the Liberians against Kabylie who are among the 10 most successful clubs in African competitions. Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah. The unexpectedly heavy loss for Kabylie was another blow to Algerian football, after the Desert Foxes were eliminated from the recent Africa Cup of Nations at the group phase. Kabylie's loss was followed by defeat for another Algerian side, Mouloudia Alger, who are also former African champions. They were beaten 2-1 away to debutants Bechem United of Ghana, but will at least have an away goal to take into their return leg next weekend. Elsewhere, Rayon Sports of Rwanda are virtually assured of a last-32 place in Africa's second-tier club competition after beating newcomers Al Salam Wau of South Sudan 4-0 in Juba. Savio Nshuti triggered a second-half goal rush by netting after 54 minutes and Pierrot Kwizera, Nova Bayama and Moussa Camara scored in the final quarter as Salam collapsed. Bosnian Enes Sipovic notched the second-half winner as Ittihad Tanger of Morocco, experiencing continental football for the first time, came from behind to defeat Douanes of Niger 2-1 in Niamey. There was more success for Morocco as second division outfit MAS Fes used home advantage to build a 3-0 lead over former African champions CARA of Congo Brazzaville. An embarrassing blunder by the Congolese goalkeeper, who allowed a harmless low cross to slip from his grasp, gifted Ivorian Koffi Boua the first goal for 2011 Confederation Cup winners Fes. Al Hilal Benghazi of Libya overcame the handicap of not being able to play at home by beating fellow Confederation Cup debutants Ulinzi Stars of Kenya 1-0 in Cairo. Ahmed Al Abbar scored the winner just after half-time for Hilal, who were forced to move the fixture to Egypt on security grounds. Volcan of the Comoros exceeded expectations by drawing 0-0 with Vipers of Uganda in Kampala, raising the prospect of a first overall African success by a club from the multi-island Indian Ocean nation. Record three-time title-holders CS Sfaxien of Tunisia are among 12 clubs who received byes into the round of 32. Like the Champions League, the Confederation Cup will have a new look this season and increased prize money. The number of qualifying rounds before play-offs against Champions League last-32 losers has been cut to two and the group phase expanded from eight clubs to 16. Prize money has been given a 170% boost, including $1.25m (\u00a31.16m) for the winners and $275,000 (\u00a3220,000) for the lowest-placed group finishers.",

She said: \"I was surprised when my daughter asked this weekend if I could help her spell 'disabled' and then she handed me her wonderful letter. \"I was so emotional that she had noticed and cared so much for her twin brother who has such multiple disabilities. \"I was so sad that a brand new park would not be automatically inclusive and so proud of my eight-year-old for standing up for her brother. \"Isaac has complex autism, is non-verbal, has global delay and learning difficulties and NF1 [disorder].

Nature charity the WWF says a total of 139 new species have been found in the South East Asia area in the past year. There are 90 plants, 23 reptiles, 16 amphibians, 9 fish and 1 mammal. The Mekong delta, which covers the countries of Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam, is one of the world's richest and diverse wildlife regions. A total of 2,216 new species have been discovered in the region in the past 17 years: that's about three every week. Now conservationists believe it's a race against the clock to document all of them, as they say threats to their habitat could mean species go extinct before they're even discovered. The colour changing thorny frog has a distinctive spiny back. At night its spikes have a pink and yellow colour; but in the daytime the yellow turns into a darker brown. The wolf snake (above) is very well camouflaged, it has large non-venomous teeth on both jaws and blends well into its mountain forest home. The crocodile newt lives around ponds and shaded places. Scientists have known about it for a long time but it's only recently been confirmed as a new species. The name of this stick insect is nearly as long as its body. The Phryganistria heusii yentuensis is the second-longest insect in the world at 54cm long - that's over half a metre! But even this is shorter than the biggest ever, discovered in Borneo: Phobaeticus chani is more than 56cm long. This bent-toed gecko is the 10,000th reptile recorded on Earth. It's one of 16 species of bent-toed geckos found last year, which puts the total at a huge 197 different species.",

Al-Rai's capture after several days of heavy fighting secures an important supply line from Turkey for the rebels. Separately, at least 200 people are missing after an IS attack on a factory near Damascus, the government says. Workers were reportedly taken from a dormitory where they were staying on the outskirts of the town of Dumeir, about 40km (25 miles) east of the capital. Activists from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say about 140 workers managed to escape. Initially there was confusion over who attacked the factory, with some sources suggesting the abductions were carried out by a rebel group called Jaysh Tahrir al-Sham. A factory administrator said no-one had been able to contact the workers since the assault on Monday. The area around Dumeir has seen fierce fighting between government forces and IS militants in recent days. The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Lebanon says that al-Rai is a crucial stronghold for IS as it sits on a crossing linking Turkey to Syria. The Observatory said that an alliance of \"rebel factions and Islamists\" had captured the town. Control of al-Rai allows opposition fighters to lay siege to positions held by IS to the north of Aleppo and cut the group's supply lines, a commander of the opposition al-Mutasim Brigade was quoted as telling local media. Al-Rai can now be be used by opposition groups as a launching pad for future operations against IS in the east and south, the commander, Mohamed Hassan Khalil, added. He said that the main dangers faced by the opposition groups fighting IS were improvised mines, booby-trapped vehicles and suicide bombers. Earlier this week IS jihadists said they had launched several attacks around north-east Damascus, including Tishrin power station and Dumeir military airport. A Syrian military source told Reuters there had been attacks but all of the militants who took part in them had been killed. It comes almost two weeks after Syrian government and allied forces recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra from IS fighters. This was also seen as a significant loss to the militant group, which had held the city since last May.",

His nine-year-old mount, trained by Mouse Morris, triumphed by six lengths. \"Everything just went to plan. I couldn't give you a word to describe how I feel,\" said the jockey. The youngster had never even walked the Aintree course before Saturday's race, but he showed his skill to make up three lengths on The Last Samuri after the final fence to take the lead at the Elbow and go on to win. Rule The World, who has twice broken his pelvis, was the first horse since the 19th century to claim his maiden win over fences at the Grand National. David Mullins was pleased to play his part in the victory for owners Gigginstown House Stud, headed by airline boss Michael O'Leary. \"Credit to Mouse, he told me before that this is probably one of the best horses he's ever had, he's just had small problems,\" added the teenager. \"So to get the call to ride this one was amazing. \"I was getting worried that everything was going to plan, and then we hit the fourth-last [fence], and I was kind of delighted once we got back into a rhythm after that that something had gone wrong and it was going to happen coming across the line.\" While there was joy for Mullins, there was frustration for Gigginstown's retained jockey Bryan Cooper, who opted to ride the winner's stable-mate First Lieutenant. They fell at the second. O'Leary had sympathy for Cooper, who rode Don Cossack to victory in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup. \"Bryan had first choice, and to be fair to him, First Lieutenant has been working out of his skin,\" he said. \"When Bryan made the decision on Thursday or Friday we were expecting good ground - had it been that way it would have been a very different race. \"But the rain came and it favoured horses at the bottom end of the handicap. \"Had Bryan been able to make the decision at three o'clock today he may well have chosen Rule The World. \"That's the problem for retained riders: sometimes they have to make tough decisions and they get it wrong.\" After his National win, Mullins rode Ivan Grozny (16-1) to victory for his uncle in the last race of the day. \"You dream of things like this,\" he said. \"I couldn't ask for much more. and to have a win for Willie is great after he gave me some good rides at Cheltenham.\" Earlier in the day, Paul Townend, replacing the injured Ruby Walsh, had a short-priced double on Yorkhill (3-10 fav) in the Mersey Novices Hurdle and Douvan (2-13 fav) in the Maghull Novices Chase, to help him to the leading jockey award.

    "source": "Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts. A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup \"viewing parties\", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team. So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game. That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date.  It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling. True, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near. Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws. Absent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid. However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic. Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974. Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball. Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship. Bundesliga: 43,532. Premier League: 36,083. La Liga: 26,803. Serie A: 22,019. Major League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148. The Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea. The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides. Last year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16. And even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina. By comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million. Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing. The average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010. All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it. More video:. Soccer seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsissyball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Deep South. Why US soccer has no relegation. Do Native Americans play football? Football in America also transcends the gender divide. Of the kids playing the game, 48% are girls. The USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany. Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years. In terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban \"soccer moms.\" The term is hardly new. It was coined in the mid-1990s. Money is another indicator of the game's attractiveness. NBC splashed out $240m (\u00c2\u00a3160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract. With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure. The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport. Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe. Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League. On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise. No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw). Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport. So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd. Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the \"Big Four\" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet. It is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls. There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions. Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game. Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system. But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport. Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources. The FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation. The Fifa allegations dominated the media here last week, and, paradoxically, that marks another milestone in the game's recognition. The game has moved from the back pages to the front.",

US President Barack Obama described his death as an \"important milestone\", but disentangling what it actually marks is not straightforward. The most obvious question is what it will mean for the Taliban. The Pentagon said it had targeted Mansour because he had become \"an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\". But it isn't clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour's former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that his approach is going to be very similar. What's more, his appointment doesn't rule out the possibility of a battle for succession. Mansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban. That would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency. Taliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm.

The drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement's leaders. So the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement. On Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what it described as a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty\". The official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks. The third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade. It would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward. Mansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different. After the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away. The Taliban needed new sources of finance. Mullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching himself and his fellow tribesmen. The movement he officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi-billion dollar drugs cartel. Afghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so-called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. But whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan's opium production is a moot point. Helmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output. A senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops. One reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year's poppy harvest. Take a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government. Last week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar-e-Sharif in the north of Afghanistan. The city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly. Conversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks. \"Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told me. \"They can see we are growing it, but they've got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money. \"The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and they know that people would be very angry if they stopped them.\" He said if the government came in and destroyed his crop or that of other farmers, they would \"take to the mountains\". \"The people will take up arms,\" he told me. \"They'll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\" Experts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country. They say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government. It occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers. On that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates. It is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002. Mansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban-controlled areas. What that suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production. Indeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes. It isn't hard to work out what that means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.",

They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season. \"There's a lot more to come from this team,\" Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport. \"Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season. \"I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically.\" Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third. They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final. Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition. The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop. \"A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script',\" he said. \"We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time. \"We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point. \"We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints. \"We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game. \"The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other. \"One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case.\"",

His career high came in the 1970s and included the anthemic Baker Street and Stuck in the Middle with You, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel. Rafferty had battled a drink problem and spent time in hospital in Bournemouth with liver failure. He was born in Paisley and began his musical career as a busker on the London Underground. Rafferty died peacefully at his home in Dorset, with his daughter Martha at his bedside. It is understood his funeral will be held in Paisley later this month. Rafferty had recorded and toured with Billy Connolly as part of the Humblebums, before forming Stealers Wheel with his friend Joe Egan in 1972. Stuck in the Middle with You was a hit in the early 70s and also appeared on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Baker Street charted in the UK and US in 1978 after Rafferty began his solo career and still achieves airplay on radio stations around the world. Musican Raphael Ravenscroft, who played the song's famous saxophone melody, described Rafferty as \"a fantastic writer\" who \"wrote some of my favourite songs of all time.\" In a statement, Billy Connolly called Rafferty \"a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed\". He added, \"I was privileged to have spent my formative years working with Gerry and there remained a strong bond of friendship between us that lasted until his untimely death. \"Gerry had extraordinary gifts and his premature passing deprives the world of a true genius.\" Music journalist and BBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said it was a cruel irony that Baker Street, about Rafferty's unhappiness with being a star, brought him more of the fame he hated. Gambaccini said: \"He just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it. \"And thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. And now we have this unhappy end.\" Musician and BBC 6 Music presenter Tom Robinson said Rafferty would be greatly missed. \"I'm deeply saddened to hear that Gerry has lost the battle with his failing health,\" he said. \"His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me. \"Many of us had hoped his recent album Life Goes On in 2009 would lead to a full-time return to writing and performing for a lyrical and highly gifted artist.\" BBC News website readers from around the world have sent in their tributes:. Don't Speak of My Heart was my favourite. His voice was like velvet.  Calmed me down just listening to him. I cannot believe he has gone. Susan Miller, Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, Scotland. Have followed his releases from Stealers Wheel to present. He wrote beautiful songs and he and Joe Egan, who sadly didn't get the same recognition, have left me some great musical memories. George Morris, Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland. As a muso myself, I loved the arrangement of the haunting Baker Street and often performed Stuck In The Middle With You with a band I was a part of in the 80s and 90s in England. Both songs are played frequently on New Zealand radio stations. Gerry will be sorely missed. Tony Last, Hastings, New Zealand. My first LP was Can I Have my Money Back, which I still have. My favourite song is The Ark from City to City with Jerry Donahue on guitar. He wrote about life itself, things one can relate to. He brought musical quality into life at times when there was not much around. Keith Dhan-Weller, Nuertingen, Germany. Baker Street is probably my favourite song. I'm a songwriter and I teach creative writing. Baker Street is about Gerry's own experience with the music industry but he wrote the lyric in the third person. This makes the story more interesting and sad. The song works on so many different levels. Musically and lyrically. Richard Abbott, Limavady, Northern Ireland. I was a young radio producer with BBC Scotland in the late 1960s when a couple of lads came in to Queen Margaret Drive to take part in some programmes. They were the Humblebums, and they made brilliant music. Rehearsals attracted all sorts of excuses from staff to absent themselves from their desks to go and listen in the studio cubicle. Little did we know... Alan Muirhead, Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, England. My eldest daughter was in school with his daughter Martha when Gerry lived in Kilmacolm. My husband and I were great fans of his music and songs and are sorry to hear of his death. Rita Walker, Greenock, Scotland. Gerry Rafferty had depths beyond his two best-selling singles.

He was speaking to the BBC's Inside Business programme about growing Northern Ireland's tourism industry. Mr Husbands took on the top job at Titanic Belfast a few months before the visitors' centre opened in 2012. In its first year of operation, more than 800,000 people from 128 countries toured the east Belfast building - double the number it was expected to achieve. Titanic Belfast welcomed its one millionth visitor in July 2013. Mr Husbands has a wealth of experience in event management, spending 15 years in charge of Belfast's Waterfront Hall. He also managed the Ulster Hall and help to stage a number of major events in the city, including the Tall Ships festival in 2009. In 2014, he was awarded an MBE from the Queen for services to economic development and tourism. Mr Husbands told Inside Business that, while there is no point creating attractions for the sake of it, parts of Northern Ireland outside Belfast need to be better served in terms of tourism and transport. \"There's no easy means of transporting people through from one city to another, from one region to another, and we need to encourage that,\" he said. \"You have to make it easy for the consumer, you have to make it easy for the guests. \"I'm not sure that we are mature enough as an industry to do that just yet.\" Tim Husbands interview will be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster as part of Inside Business at 13:30 GMT on Sunday 20 November.",

The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is \u00a3555,000. The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery. Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. Read Will's blog. After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for \u00a3554,937.50. Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price. The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of \u00a3333,000 and \u00a3100,000, while the NPG has also contributed. The Lottery Fund's grant will go towards the acquisition, as well as the costs of conserving, displaying and touring the painting around other galleries and museums in the UK. Broadcaster and National Portrait Gallery trustee, Zeinab Badawi, said: \"This portrait is a rare example of a painting of an 18th Century African in Britain. \"This portrait would be a vital and powerful addition to the collection at the National Portrait Gallery for its representation of Britain's diverse cultural heritage.\"",

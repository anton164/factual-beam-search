    "source": "Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism. Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult. The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction. The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures. Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: \"At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way. \"That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury. \"Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\" Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council. The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further. He added: \"CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also. \"The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.\" Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents. The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis. Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: \"I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here. \"People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe. \"The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.\" Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there. A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total. Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise \u00c2\u00a360,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \"Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling. \"There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues. \"The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling.\" A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: \"We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis. \"Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them. \"Public security measures such as CCTV are not uncommon practice within other historic sites and buildings and we would work with the applicant to discuss possible options.\"",

The tourist, a certified diver, was helped to the surface but could not be revived. It comes after two French tourists died while snorkelling on the reef at Michaelmas Cay on Wednesday. They are both believed to have suffered cardiac arrests. Paramedics were alerted to the latest tragedy just after 12.30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Friday. \"CPR was performed on a male patient in his sixties by a nurse on board a vessel and subsequently by a doctor,\" a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said. The Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO) said the alarm was raised when the diver was spotted without a regulator in his mouth 15m (49ft) below sea level on the ocean floor. \"We're not sure as to what has happened at this stage,\" a Quicksilver spokeswoman said. The man was travelling with his wife. It was his second dive of the day from a boat called Silver Sonic. AMPTO executive director Col McKenzie said the boat was carrying oxygen and defibrillation equipment and had operated for 11 years without serious incident. \"Accidents like this are a tragedy for the surviving family members, the crew and the passengers,\" he said. Agincourt Reef is about 100km (62 miles) north of the city of Cairns, and about 60km north of Michaelmas Cay.",

    "source": "The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks \"threatened internet safety\". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. \"The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,\" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read \"Do you have a conscience?\".",

Sunni rebels led by militant group Isis have occupied large swathes of northern and western Iraq. They have declared a large region straddling Iraq and Syria a caliphate or Islamic state. About 10,000 Indians are reported to be working in Iraq. Scores of them have returned to India since fighting began. \"We are very happy [to be freed],\" Marina Jose, one of the nurses released by the militants told NDTV. \"We never thought we would come out because the situation was very bad.\" She said that the militants had for the most part treated them well. At the airport: Imran Qureshi, BBC News, Kochi. The nurses received a tumultuous welcome, led by their families and the chief minister of the southern state of Kerala, Oomen Chandy. Every political party was represented. The nurses gave differing accounts of how they had been treated. One nurse, Shermin Varghese, told the BBC the militants in Tikrit had said they were being taken to an airport. Another, Marina Jose, said they had been told only that they were heading to Mosul. They said they had burst into tears when the militants showed them their bombs and ammunition on the bus. But both of them said they had not been mistreated. The exact circumstances of their release are unclear - they are reported to have been pressured into boarding buses and leaving the hospital by jihadist fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis). They were reportedly then taken to Mosul before being freed. The specially-chartered flight was also carrying about 100 other Indians leaving Iraq. Tikrit is among a number of towns and cities seized by jihadist-led Sunni rebels in recent weeks. Some of the nurses told the BBC by phone a few days ago that fighting had reached the hospital compound and there had been several explosions close to where they had been hiding.",

    "source": "However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. \"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. \"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained. \"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\" It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. \"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said. \"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. \"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\" Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. \"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. \"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. \"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube.",

Two more were suspended, while three others were banned for other misconduct involving sexual content. The National Union of Teachers said it was not a common occurrence in schools. David Evans, secretary of National Union of Teachers Cymru, said: \"We have to be mindful when reviewing these figures that this is a very small number of teachers across the whole profession over a period of a few years. This is by no means a common occurrence in our schools.\" He added the union often dealt with malicious and false allegations against teachers, which remained a concern, but said it was right allegations were investigated and any teachers found abusing their positions should face the full consequences. Donald Findlater, of child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said the changing online environment and social networking in recent years had introduced \"massive challenges and risks\". He said some staff got into trouble out of naivety, rather than malice, and schools must ensure adequate training is given so teachers know the boundaries. A spokeswoman for child abuse charity NSPCC Cymru said: \"Schools need to be rigorous in their recruitment and checking processes and provide regular training about appropriate behaviour, making it absolutely clear that crossing the line will never be tolerated.\" During the same period, other teachers were disciplined after being convicted of driving, alcohol, drugs, harassment and fraud offences. Others were punished for assaulting pupils, helping children cheat during tests, failing to achieve required standards, not following health and safety procedures, and failing to investigate bullying.",

    "source": "Alex Gray, from Perth in Tayside, is awaiting sentence after being convicted earlier this month of burglary and harassment. The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed \"the system has failed him\", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a \"nuisance rather than a victim\" by police, adding that the experience had left her \"a changed person\". Gray's mother Michelle said she had tried to get help for her son from the authorities for years. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain programme, she said: \"I had no idea that he had been stalking Lily Allen and putting her through these years of torture. \"We knew he had a fixation with her but not that he had actually been anywhere near her. \"We just thought he had a fantasy in his head.\" What's the difference between a super-fan and a stalker? It's not the first time a celebrity has received obsessive attention, but what are the stages that lead to somebody becoming a dangerous stalker? Lily Allen was relaxing in her flat last year when a stalker broke in and confronted her in her bedroom. \"I'm lying in bed and I can see the door handle moving and then he steams in, starts screaming and shouting... I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.  It was the culmination of an ordeal that started back in 2008 when Gray first contacted Allen on Twitter. Over time he began turning up at her house and office, left abusive notes and made suicide threats. READ MORE. She added: \"We knew he had a mental disorder and he had been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia two years ago and he was meant to be on medication for this, but nobody was ensuring that that was happening. \"It escalated after his dad died. He got worse and we knew he was getting worse. We tried to get him help and nobody would help us at all.\" His sister Kaylie Gray said: \"I don't think it's going to be good for either party - for Alex, for us, for her (Allen) - if he just goes to prison because he's not going to get any help. \"He's just going to continue to get worse and then he's going to get released without any help and we are just back to square one again.\" Asked if Gray had shown any remorse, his sister replied: \"No, Alex is a very closed book. \"He doesn't like to talk about anything and because of his disorder he thinks people are tapping phones, so he won't talk to me about things like that over the phone.\" His mother added: \"He finds it hard to... separate what's real and what's not real, it's part of his illness, I think.\" Kaylie Gray said the family has not had any contact with Lily Allen. She added: \"We are really sorry that it got this far. It's horrendous what her and her family have had to go through and obviously we feel so horrible for her.\" In an interview with The Observer, Allen said: \"Until he gets the right treatment and the right help he needs, then I'm not safe. \"You can throw the book at him, put him in jail, but he'll still be coming out. And the victim is never safe.\" A Metropolitan Police spokesman would not comment on Allen's case but said they took stalking and harassment \"extremely seriously\".",

    "source": "Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13. The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of \"bed days\" per patient per year has fallen by 10%. Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support. Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home. \"What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.\" Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients. Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk. \"The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,\" he said. Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013. He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team. His wife, Linda, said: \"They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.\" Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death. The coroner said he \"required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available\". South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: \"The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.\" According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by \u00a329.3m from \u00a3520m. Her annual report notes this is \"significant\" given \"the co-existing reduction in bed availability\". Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem. \"Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding. \"If the government is serious about putting mental health care on an equal footing with physical health, then it's going to need a really serious commitment in the next parliament.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Commissioners are expected to give a real-terms funding increase to mental health this year. \"NHS funding for mental health increased by \u00a3300m last year.\"",

A new \"UK settled status\" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK \"does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up\". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining \"UK settled status\" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, \"I hate Brexit from every angle.\" \"It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,\" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. \"I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,\" Mr Rutte said. \"I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.\" Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. \"This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,\" he said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Toronto police said the stage collapsed at 16:00 local time (20:00). Police said the person who died was a man in his 30s, but did not reveal his identity. The victims were all part of a team involved with setting up the stage, officials said. Alexandra Halbert, who was working in a beer tent at the show, said she was about 200-300 yards away from the stage, with her back to it, when she heard \"something that sounded like fireworks\". \"I turned around and the whole top part of the stage had collapsed, as well as the scaffolding,\" she told the BBC. \"It seemed like there were a couple of minutes of hesitation and no one knew quite what to do. It was only afterwards that we all realised how serious it was.\" Jason Ip, a food vendor, said there was \"chaos\" as people waited for the emergency services to arrive. \"A few people started running towards the stage. No one knew exactly what had happened, but it was clear that people were underneath the stage,\" he said. \"It was like witnessing a car accident. In a situation like that, you just aren't sure how to react.\" Some 40,000 people were expected for the sold-out gig, which was also due to feature Canadian musician Caribou.",

The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth. The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70\u2009million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January. Morricone's soundtrack will be released by Decca on 18 December.",

    "source": "Gareth Southgate's side went out in the group stage in the Czech Republic. \"We made the decision and I back it,\" Ashworth told the BBC's senior football reporter Ian Dennis. \"Youth teams are there to help develop players and give them experience to get into the seniors.\" Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, Arsenal midfielders Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere and Manchester United defender Phil Jones were among those eligible but not called up. Media playback is not supported on this device. Ashworth added: \"Those players are established internationals. It's like being a first-team player and asking them to come back and play in the U21s. It's not necessarily the right thing to do. \"The players who hadn't competed in the two-year cycle and lead-up to the European Championship wouldn't be considered. \"The debate will be reopened now but we stand by the decision Gareth and I made. You never know when you drop players into a new group whether it'll be the right thing to do.\" England, who had Premier League quality in Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton defender John Stones and new Liverpool forward Danny Ings, lost 1-0 to Portugal, beat Sweden by the same score but then lost 3-1 to Italy. Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. \"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories. \"In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams. \"They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that. We can't after six months say that's wrong, let's just crash it down the other end as quickly as we can. \"We're starting to see a different kind of player come through the system now. Three years into EPPP [Elite Player Performance Plan] we're seeing players more capable with the ball. I believe it will stand us in good stead in years to come. Is it too soon now to see that? Yes, perhaps.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. FA chairman Greg Dyke set a target in 2013 for England to win the World Cup by 2022 and Ashworth is adamant that this remains a realistic goal. \"Yes I do believe that,\" he said. \"I genuinely believe we have a lot of good young players in the system. We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. \"We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. \"You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments. But that takes time - it doesn't happen overnight. \"We're all doing the right things but we need to sit tight and be a little patient and let it run its course. I'm convinced it will.\" Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker criticised the \"exasperatingly amateurish approach\" not to select players such as Sterling, Wilshere and Barkley for the tournament. \"We never learn. What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience,\" the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the \"culture is rotten\" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. \"There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament,\" he told BBC 5 live. \"We have a talent pool to match any nation. It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things. \"The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom. The England national team will underperform at every single tournament for this reason. \"The players think 'I'm too good for the under-21s, I've been in a senior squad - I don't want to go to a major tournament. I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'. \"Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it. That's the problem with the Premier League being stronger than the FA. It's impossible for England to build good teams. \"The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. \"I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line.\" Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. \"We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. \"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff. Raheem Sterling doesn't want to play for Liverpool - he certainly would have caused more problems for the under-21s than he would have done them good. \"When me and Joey were coming through, playing for the under-21s and national team was massive kudos. \"That doesn't happen now, they're given so much so early in club football that England Under-21s has become secondary. There isn't the same desire to play for them. Spain and Germany still have the desire to play for their Under-21s - they get paid an awful lot less than our players. \"English players are paid too much and clubs put pressure on them not to go to the tournament - 'We want to save you for next season'. We have to change this culture. \"I can't believe players even consider not playing for the under-21s. Those players like Barkley or Sterling could have called Gareth up and said 'I want to be in your side'.\" You can listen to BBC Radio 5 live's Dan Ashworth interview and the reaction to the England Under-21s' performance from Joey Barton and Danny Mills here.",

Mr Gove said he regretted standing for the Tory leadership, saying he made \"mistakes\" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a Gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron. He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 June poll, he said. Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job. Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way\". \"As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made... \"I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches. \"When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too,\" said Mr Gove. \"So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \"I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr Gove said he is now focusing on his work on the Commons committee on exiting the EU and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

    "source": "Jack Beales, 93, of Rhyl, carried out the attacks while she was a young girl, mainly when he was in his 70s. He denied five charges of rape and six other sexual offences but was unanimously convicted by the jury at Mold Crown Court on 9 December. Sentencing him on Wednesday, Judge Rhys Rowlands said Beales had destroyed his victim's childhood. His victim, now aged in her 30s, took to the witness stand to read her victim impact statement. The court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years. She said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped, when she confronted Beales last summer, it would bring some kind of closure. But she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety, and was awaiting counselling. The court had heard she confronted Beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child. He later said \"that was what men did\". The woman said every time she came into contact with Beales he made hurtful comments. She said: \"Once again I felt suicidal and felt I could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life, with no apparent suffering.\" The woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family. But she added: \"I worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean I am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term.\" She said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world \"as a very dangerous place\". \"I am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men,\" she told the court. \"I feel unable to relax, and as though I have a responsibility to be watchful over others.\" Defending barrister Andrew Green said Beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes. Jailing him, Judge Rowlands said Beales did not have \"an ounce of remorse\" and was \"devoid of any moral compass at all\". He will have to serve a further 12 months on licence. Det Insp William Jones, of North Wales Police, said: \"John (Jack) Beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time. He is now thankfully behind bars. \"No child should ever have to experience what the victim went through.\" An NSPCC Wales spokesman said the victim \"must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so Beales could eventually face justice for his crimes\".",

    "source": "His solicitor Julia Cooper has asked Surrey Police to explain a statement that he had confessed to the murder. Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a \"covert tape\" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said \"my client denies giving a confession\". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police.",

    "source": "They will consider plans by Third Energy to frack a well at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in the district of Ryedale. Campaigners say approval would set a \"dangerous precedent\". But the company says its operations are no risk to people or the environment. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into rocks deep underground to unlock trapped gas. The process was banned in 2011 after the shale gas firm Cuadrilla caused minor earth tremors when it fracked a well in Lancashire. Third Energy has licences to produce gas in North Yorkshire and offshore in the North Sea. In 2013 it drilled an exploratory well near the village of Kirby Misperton, close to the North York Moors National Park. It now wants to frack the well to test whether it can unlock shale gas from rocks up to 10,000ft (3,000m) underground. \"All we want to do is test whether gas will flow from an existing well using hydraulic fracturing,\" says Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy. \"What we are planning is safe. There is no risk to the environment or the public.\" But there has been strong opposition to the plan from the local community and environmentalists. Hundreds of anti-fracking protesters are expected to gather outside the council meeting in Northallerton on Friday. The council has received more than 4,000 representations, the vast majority against the proposal. Green campaigners fear that approval here would open the door for fracking elsewhere. \"It risks setting a dangerous precedent for Britain,\" says Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth. \"We strongly urge councillors to reject this planning application which is clearly deeply unpopular with the local community.\" Others are concerned about the impact on the local economy as Kirby Misperton is also home to Flamingo Land, one of Yorkshire's top tourists attractions. \"This place is beautiful,\" says retired bishop, the Right Reverend Graham Cray, who lives in the village. \"The economy is based on tourism and agriculture. Tourists don't come to a gas field and that is what we will turn into if we get the scale of fracking that is intended.\" Last year Lancashire County Council rejected Cuadrilla's plan to carry out exploratory drilling and fracking at two new sites on the Fylde. A planning inquiry into that application took place earlier this year. A recommendation will be sent in the summer to the communities secretary for a final decision. The Third Energy application involves an existing site that has produced gas since the 1990s. The well has already been drilled. The shale gas produced will also be sent through a network of pipes to a nearby power station. That will avoid air pollution caused by flaring gas. So the company expects the fracking activity to be completed within eight weeks. The council's planning officer has recommended that the application be approved. But it is now down to the 11 councillors on the planning committee to take the final decision. That decision may not come until Monday due to the number of people who have registered to speak at the meeting. If approved, fracking could start by the end of the year. The Department of Energy and Climate Change refused to comment on Third Energy's application ahead of the council meeting. But in a statement it said: \"Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity which will create jobs, boost our economy and strengthen our energy security. \"There is tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking can take place safely - now is the time to start exploration and find out just how much shale gas is there and how much we can get out of the ground.\" You can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\". A children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned. Yet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services. Lord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016. Citing the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\". He did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat. New initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself. He said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone. \"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world. \"We are extremely ambitious for this new service. \"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\" The government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition. Other BBC plans include:. The director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\". Quality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution. \"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers). Partnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition. The second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart. The BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a \u00c2\u00a3650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced. Lord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the \u00c2\u00a3600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made. He said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\" Details of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added. In a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future. \"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television. The Ideas Service might mean we no longer need BBC Four.\" Later in the same document, though, the BBC states \"it is too early to be specific about the service changes that we will need to make.\" The BBC's plans for \"a network of 100 public service reporters across the country\" did not find favour with the Scottish Newspaper Society, who labelled the proposal \"a Trojan horse which will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies\". \"Instead of helping local news publishers, it would make the BBC even more powerful and would further concentrate coverage of news in the hands of the state-funded broadcaster,\" said its director John McLellan. The News Media Association, which represents national, regional and local news media organisations across the UK, expressed similar concerns, saying the corporation's proposals represented \"BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door\". \"The local newspaper sector already employs thousands of journalists and is the only reliable source of independent and trusted local news across the UK,\" said its vice chairman Ashley Highfield. \"There is no deficit which the BBC needs to plug.\" \"Under the guise of being helpful, the BBC would end up replacing independent local news services,\" Mr McLellan told Radio 4's The World at One earlier, calling the plan \"a further expansion of the BBC's encroachment\". Yet this accusation was rejected by James Purnell, the BBC's director of strategy, who told the same programme it was \"very much not the goal\" for the BBC to \"take over all local journalism\".",

    "source": "It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market. \"One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,\" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study. The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures. Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations. But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places. \"The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,\" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch. In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are \"less accepting\" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities. This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector. Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education. The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison. But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language. It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three. As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens. Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been \"encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria\". There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese. Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium \"designated schools\". But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment. As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools. \"Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,\" says Ms Yip. But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying. Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home. Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework. \"There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,\" says Ms Yip. Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools. \"I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.\" After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013. But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues. \"Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,\" says Ms Yip. In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a \"learning framework\" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese. Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (\u00c2\u00a368,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them. But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness. \"It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,\" she says. \"Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,\" says Unison's Ms Yip. Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups. A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare. Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service. Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries. The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate. \"I identify as a Hongkonger,\" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills. \"If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.\" \"The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,\" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.",

Chloe Stott, 18, is the daughter of Katy Stott, who was born 2,000ft above Orkney in 1973 on a special air ambulance flight from the island of Stronsay to Kirkwall. The aircraft was only a few minutes into the short flight when Katy's mother Freida Devin gave birth. Chloe said she has always wanted to be a cabin crew attendant. Thick fog prevented the aircraft from landing in Kirkwall, and Captain Jamie Bayley had to divert to Aberdeen.

The plant will create 150 jobs on the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone, which is still hoping to be home to the \u00c2\u00a3325m Circuit of Wales. New owners, who bought the British brand three years ago, will start production next year. The company has a 10-year plan, including four new models, and will begin making a few hundred cars a year. TVR had been looking at three sites around the UK. Mr Jones said: \"This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector. \"TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales.\" There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year. TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government. \"South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.\" The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially. It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton. Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength. THE HISTORY OF THE TVR. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent. The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth \u00c2\u00a33.2bn a year. But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative. It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers. As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines. That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries. TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant. It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%. The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal. But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement \"sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing\". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was \"surging from strength to strength.\" He added: \"Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.\" Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year. Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as \"fantastic\" for the region. \"Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,\" he added.",

Terribly illegally.\" Jones says his side have a stronger scrum, adding if the laws are enforced England \"will get an advantage\". Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. \"He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,\" said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been \"found out\" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. \"There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted,\" said McBryde. \"So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere.\" However, Jones says he is \"quite upset\" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. \"They play the laws very well,\" the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. \"They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. \"And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. \"Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens? The referee gets criticised. \"We really want to have a scrum contest on Saturday - it's an important part of the game - so we are really hopeful the referee enforces the law in that area.\" Jones added: \"If you are the referee and you keep penalising Wales for pre-engaging, then all the smart guys in the commentators' box say 'this referee is ruining the game'. \"But they are not ruining the game, it's the team that is scrummaging illegally which is ruining the game. \"So we want the referee to be really hard, and if he has to ruin the game, he has to ruin the game.\"",

But after \"time to reflect\" on the meeting and feedback from fans, he has now \"withdrawn from any involvement\". He had said: \"I'm not convinced change will happen quickly or thoroughly enough under Fawaz's ownership.\" But following his decision to withdraw his interest, he explained: \"As for fans which questioned my motive, I want the club to be in safe hands, competitive and in the top division. \"My current business, career and health are way more important to me than pushing against a tide of doubt, spite and rabble rousing, so I'll stick to the odd Q&A in Nottingham now and again to say hello to those who supported me back in the day.\" Collymore was involved in a protest against Al Hasawi on 21 January, which followed the collapse of a proposed takeover of the club by a US-based consortium led by John Jay Moores. \"I believe Fawaz will stay in the short/medium term,\" Collymore wrote on his blog. \"Unless JJM [Moores] meet the asking price of \u00a350m or as Fawaz said \"the Chinese offer silly money\", it is my belief that he feels he has the resources, passion and plan to move the club forward.\" Forest are currently 19th in the Championship, just five points above the relegation zone. They sacked manager Philippe Montanier on 14 January, making the Frenchman the seventh to leave the City Ground since the Al Hasawi family took over in July 2012. Meanwhile, the Nottingham Forest Supporters' Trust have been given an assurance by the city council that the land on which the City Ground is built will never be sold. The stadium is owned by the club, but the land still belongs to the council. The Supporters' Trust have also applied to register the City Ground as an Asset of Community Value, meaning they would have first refusal to purchase the stadium if it were ever to be sold, with six months to raise the required funds. \"This is a key safeguarding measure for the future of our football club,\" a spokesperson said. \"With our membership now live and having already seen hundreds of members join up, we have a huge wealth of skills to call upon to continue to push further initiatives forward.\"",

Bayern need a maximum of 11 points from their final five league matches to secure the title for Guardiola before he leaves to join Manchester City at the end of the season. The Bayern boss rotated his squad with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg trip to Benfica in mind, beginning with Thomas Muller, Philipp Lahm, Costa and Thiago on the bench. But he brought on Muller after just 27 minutes, concerned that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal was in danger of getting sent off after making two reckless challenges and collecting an early booking. Stuttgart captain Niedermeier scored at the wrong end as he stretched to prevent Franck Ribery's cross reaching Robert Lewandowski. Austria international Alaba added another early in the second half, showing neat footwork before beating goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton at the near post. Didavi, Stuttgart's leading scorer, improvised superbly to pull a goal back with just under half-an-hour left as he hooked the ball past Manuel Neuer while on the ground for his 11th of the season, but Costa's 25-yard drive ended hopes of a comeback. Augsburg moved out of the bottom three as they came from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Werder Bremen, who dropped into the relegation play-off place.

    "source": "The area, which accounts for 21% of all second-home ownership in England, is to get \u00a319.1m of the \u00a360m annual fund. The money will be distributed to \"community-led\" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing. Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991. The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices. It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years. In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that \u00a360m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on \"community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities\". The Department for Communities and Local Government said the \u00a360m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem. It announced that the South West is set to get \u00a319,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly. The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, \u00a311,336,157. The East of England will get \u00a38.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside \u00a36.4m and the North-West nearly \u00a36m. Friday's breakdown also includes \u00a32.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (\u00a32.7m). West Midlands (\u00a31.9m) and north-east England (\u00a31.3m). In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills.. Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: \"We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.\" Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: \"The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community. \"This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.\" During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas. It \"must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people\" during the second year. But Labour's Mr Healey said: \"Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991. \"After six years of failure on housing, people want to see government ministers get to grips with the country's housing crisis not produce more press releases.\" Councillor Martin Tett, for the Local Government Association,. LGA housing spokesman, said there must be a \"renaissance in house building by councils\" to provide enough affordable homes to rent and buy: \"This means powers and funding [being] given to councils to replace sold homes and reinvest in building more of the genuinely affordable homes our communities desperately need.\"",

Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. \"Some of the comments went too far,\" Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. \"If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to,\" he said. Haye added he now has a \"different kind of respect\" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. \"When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring,\" he said. \"When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way.\" Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing \"irreparable damage\" to his ankle and foot. \"It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap,\" he said. \"I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. \"I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. \"I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short.\" Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch \"solely depends on Tony\" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. \"I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody,\" he said. \"Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. \"Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. \"For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion.\"",

Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events. 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor. In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images. BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch. Full coverage: Queen at 90. Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview. BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell. The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations. Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".",

    "source": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

Among them were members of the governing Workers Party and groups which back President Dilma Rousseff. But the names, published in a magazine, also included rivals of Ms Rousseff. Many of the names were published in Veja, one of Brazil's leading magazines, just weeks before the presidential election in which Ms Rousseff is running for a second term in office. Several politicians mentioned have denied involvement. Mr Costa claimed that politicians received 3% commissions on the values of contracts signed with Petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012. He alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes. Mr Costa was arrested in 2013. He is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names. Ahead of the election, Ms Rousseff's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival, former Environment Minister Marina Silva. The BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro says the latest allegations could hurt the incumbent further, as during her presidency Petrobras has dramatically underperformed and its costs have risen sharply. It has become one of the world's most indebted oil companies and lost half of its market value in three years. The BBC has requested a comment from Petrobras about the latest allegations and is awaiting a response.",

The vigils were held on 13 November in Bristol, London, Cape Town and also Sweden where she was born. South African authorities have applied to have Mr Dewani extradited over claims he was involved in her murder. He denies the charges. Taxi driver Zola Tongo from Bothasig, Cape Town, has been jailed for 18 years for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice after agreeing a plea bargain. Mr Dewani, from Bristol, faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice. Mr Dewani's extradition was backed by Home Secretary Theresa May after a judge approved the move in August. An appeal has been lodged with the High Court. Mrs Dewani's uncle, Manoj Panchmatia, who helped organise the vigils, said it had been \"a very difficult year for the family\". \"We are all looking for some form of closure,\" he added. Mr Panchmatia said the idea had come from users of Facebook who wanted to do \"something special\". He said the family had received hundreds of emails from people saying they planned to light a candle. The vigils, including one in Harrow, north London, where Mrs Dewani lived with relatives before getting married, were scheduled for 17:30 GMT. Two other men, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, are also charged with murder, as well as kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances and will go on trial at the Western Cape High Court next year.

    "source": "Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko told Germany's Bild newspaper: \"The idea of Mercedes is finished. We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device. The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise their veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage. Renault, which supplies only Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso in F1, is in the final stages of negotiations to take over the financially troubled Lotus team, although no deal has yet been completed. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said the Italian company was prepared to supply Red Bull if necessary. He said he was not concerned about their reputation for being able to build highly-competitive chassis in F1, led by their design chief Adrian Newey. Arrivabene said: \"In theory they have big names, with Newey as chief designer and it is easy to think that if you give them the engine they will build a scary chassis, which means they will be really competitive. \"Concerning my team, my engineers and aerodynamicists know their own jobs. For that reason I don't have a problem, and competition is nice when you have a stronger competitor. \"This doesn't mean tomorrow morning we will give our engines to Red Bull or Toro Rosso. \"But I don't see any kind of problem to give our engine to any other team or be scared of the competition before they start. \"This is not the right spirit of competition or what Ferrari represents. We fight with everybody.\"",

    "source": "Derek Bruder was giving evidence as the inquests focused on the final movements of 15-year-old Kevin Williams. He said he made his first statement shortly after the 1989 disaster and was visited by police the following year. While the meeting left him \"confused\", he agreed to make changes. The officer concerned, former Insp Matthew Sawers, denied asking Mr Bruder to change the sense of his statement. Mr Bruder told the inquests into the 96 deaths at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 that he was visited by an inspector from West Midlands Police, who were supplying evidence to the first inquests. He said Insp Sawers spent six hours with him. When the officer went to the bathroom, Mr Bruder said he looked through some of his notes. He said he found a sheet of paper divided lengthways in two, with handwritten notes on it. On one side it said \"first statement\" and on the other side it said \"change to\", Mr Bruder said. During the meeting he said he was asked to speak over the phone to a pathologist from the coroner's office. Mr Bruder, who was 22 at the time of the disaster, said he conceded \"to the doctor's medical superiority\" when it was suggested Kevin could not have been alive when Mr Bruder tried to revive him. He agreed to make changes to his original statement. Among them he accepted he may have been mistaken to say he had felt \"a faint pulse\" while trying to save Kevin. Mr Bruder told the jury he was 100% confident he had felt a pulse and had seen the teenager move while lying on the pitch. The court heard he wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2012 to say West Midlands Police had made a \"deliberate attempt\" to make him change his statement. He told the inquests he stood by that view and the inspector who visited him had not been honest with him. Earlier Mr Bruder told the inquests that, along with a St John Ambulance volunteer medic who gave heart massage, he had tried to resuscitate Kevin. He said he was \"absolutely 100% confident\" he felt a pulse in the teenager's neck, adding: \"It was not something that would appear to me to be absolutely healthy, beating vibrantly, but there was definitely a pulse.\" Asked whether he saw any signs of life while giving CPR, Mr Bruder said: \"Well, to me he was alive. There was a faint pulse.\" The jury also heard from two Liverpool fans who tried to help Kevin while Mr Bruder was with him. One of them, Stephen Rankin, said Kevin did not show any signs of life. Mr Bruder said a female St John Ambulance medic eventually joined the group, and took over the CPR. After trying to resuscitate him she said Kevin had died. Mr Sawers, who was formerly in charge of coronial inquiries for West Midlands Police, told the inquests he had been asked by the original coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to visit Mr Bruder to get further explanation and detail around evidence, including the convulsions and pulse. He was to give a summary of the further statement to the inquests the following day, but denied he had applied pressure on Mr Bruder or had attended with the intention of changing his statement. Mr Sawers said: \"I did not cause him to change the sense of the statement. What I did was to go through the details and to elicit more detail and explanation. \"Everything that I did in my encounter with PC Bruder was done with integrity and with the best of intentions. It wasn't something that I had any personal stake in.\" But Pete Weatherby, representing Kevin's family, suggested there had been \"a determined effort\" to change his statement which was \"inconvenient to the investigation\". Mr Weatherby said that \"it was very inconvenient that here was a serving police officer giving evidence of vital signs in a casualty that died\". He suggested that as a result of the meeting, Mr Sawers came away with a second statement that \"loosened up\" evidence about Kevin's vital signs.

A jury is currently hearing the new inquests in Warrington before coroner Lord Justice Goldring. Mrs Aspinall said: \"It's not just about Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall, it's about everybody involved in this.

Five Saudis, reportedly including a prince, were detained at Beirut's airport after two tonnes of pills branded as Captagon were found in cases due to be loaded onto a private jet. It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. However, it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because of it was too addictive. In 2013, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said 64% of global seizures of amphetamine took place in the Middle East, and that most of the amphetamine was in the form of Captagon pills.",

Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: \"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.\"",

Sergei Glazyev said the US was spending $20m (\u00c2\u00a312.3m; 14.8m euros) a week on Ukrainian opposition groups, supplying \"rebels\" with arms among other things. Accusing the US of ignoring the Memorandum on Security Assurances, he suggested Moscow could also intervene. The American embassy in Kiev declined to comment on his accusations. 21 November 2013: Ukraine announces it will not sign a deal aimed at strengthening ties with the EU, sparking protests. 17 December: Russia agrees to buy $15bn of Ukrainian government bonds and slash the price of gas it sells to the country. 16 January 2014: Parliament passes law restricting the right to protest. 22 January: Two protesters die from bullet wounds during clashes with police in Kiev; protests spread across many cities. 25 January: President Yanukovych offers senior jobs to the opposition, including that of prime minister, but these are rejected. 28 January: Parliament votes to annul protest law and President Yanukovych accepts resignation of PM and cabinet. 29 January: Parliament passes amnesty law for detained protesters, under the condition occupied buildings are vacated. Ukraine's protest leaders. Q&A: Stand-off in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is due to meet Mr Putin on Friday in Sochi, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games there. He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition. Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive. The two speakers also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders in the conversation. The US embassy declined to comment on the tape. Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday. They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully. In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House. He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed. Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: \"According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.\" The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR. Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant. He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force. \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],\" he said. \"Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\" Accusing the Americans of \"interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine\", he said: \"There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.\" Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would \"normalise\" if the US desisted from intervening. Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states. The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment. It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition. At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured. The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists. One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days. \"I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,\" said Mr Bulatov, 35. \"At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.\"",

Last June, Sylvester went on a three-week sheep-killing spree, wandering 300km (180 miles) before he was found taking a nap by rangers and airlifted from the Nuweveld Mountains. When he was found he was fitted with a tracking collar. The second time he escaped, rescuers followed the signal from his collar to find him high up in the mountains in Western Cape again. He was tranquilised and airlifted by helicopter, an operation the park authorities captured on video. He had been away for four days.",

Innogy Renewables UK said the decision to withdraw the application was made following a late request for additional information. It said that Natural Resources Wales' river basin management plan for western Wales had been updated last December, including a change to the sensitivity of salmon fisheries, following which further information had been requested. The project, providing power to 3,200 households, attracted opposition from environmentalists, anglers, canoeists and businesses. The firm has previously said it would have had a positive impact on the environment but campaigners were worried half an acre of the centuries-old Fairy Glen Wood would be destroyed by the build. In March, the park's authority turned the plans down, asking for clarification on \"minor issues\". Innogy Renewables UK Ltd said it would now consider its next steps.

The 12ft-high (3.6m) statue features about 40,000 spoons and has taken almost five months to build at the British Ironworks Centre in Oswestry. The spoons have been donated from across the world, as well as local schoolchildren. It is due to be transported to Mr Geller's home in Berkshire on 28 May. It was hoped the statue could be transported to Berkshire by helicopter, but after safety fears, the Ironworks Centre said the TV production company behind Shipping Wars had stepped forward to help. By Bethan BellBBC News. About 250 people toasted the unveiling of the gorilla statue in a sunny Oswestry. The British Ironworks Centre had long kept the project under wraps so there was a palpable sense of intrigue and anticipation about what a 12ft high gorilla made entirely of spoons would actually look like. Uri Geller was clearly very pleased with the end result. He even signed bent spoons for a few of the children who came along to the unveiling. While Mr Geller laid down the challenge of creating a giant gorilla, Clive Knowles, managing director of the British Ironworks Centre, said it had been built for the nation and funded by the firm. He said he was hoping the statue would ultimately live somewhere more accessible to the public and that the firm was in contact with Great Ormond Street Hospital as a possible location. Many of the spoons have been sent from as far away as China, India, Kenya, Tahiti and Armenia. Mr Geller, a friend of Prince Michael, himself donated a spoon once owned by Winston Churchill. Speaking at the unveiling, in front of a large crowd, Mr Geller described the statue as \"an amazing piece of art\". He said: \"This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.\" \"I am not going to look at the gorilla too hard in case the spoons bend,\" he added. \"It has been an amazing day and Clive has made the impossible possible. Sculptor Alfie Bradley, who has hand-welded every spoon to the statue, said he had been amazed at how the appeal for cutlery had taken off on social media. \"Initially we thought we only needed 5,000 spoons, but it's incredibly hard to calculate and it turned out we actually needed 40,000,\" he said. \"It's been incredibly repetitive, but it's been a challenge. The spoons have been different sizes, different metals.\" He said the project had given him \"sleepless nights\" and now \"just the word 'spoon' is enough to drive me crazy\". Mr Bradley added that the gorilla's pose, with one fist breaking out of a cage, had been inspired by the film King Kong. Due to the number of spoons donated by schoolchildren across the world, he said he had come to think of the statue as \"a protector\" of children. Teams from the centre have given presentations at schools in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire in an appeal for spoons, but the firm soon looked overseas. Mr Knowles said he believed the past five months had cost the firm about \u00c2\u00a3120,000 in staff time, but described it as an \"exciting rollercoaster of a ride\". He said the experience had given the firm \"an immense appetite to do something even better\" and appealed to the public to suggest a new project that would \"celebrate Britain\".",

From prison he told his now estranged wife Giulia Masciopinto, 37, to unearth cash buried in their Bedford garden. She has been jailed for nine months. Her mother Caterina De Filippo, 58, and sister Palma De Filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico Masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term. His wife also pleaded guilty to the charge, but the De Filippos, who she enlisted but who denied the accusations, were found guilty last month. Judge Kristina Montgomery QC, sitting at Amersham Law Courts for Aylesbury Crown Court, said the Masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the Bedford homes of Giulia Masciopinto, in Redhall Close, and her mother's in Harrowden Road, in March 2013. Officers were alerted by Masciopinto's recorded prison calls to his wife, as he feared the buried cash would perish as it was not in watertight containers. A holdall containing \u00a3237,000 was discovered, while thousands of pounds were also found in a handbag, plastic bag and foil-wrapped bundles. Other money had been paid into bank accounts. Palma De Filippo, of High St, Acton, west London, helped by hiding some of the cash in her car boot and laundering it. Det Insp Pushpa Guild, of Bedfordshire Police, called it a \"sophisticated attempt\" to hide criminal proceeds. Police said some seized cash would go towards paying a \u00a3121,736 confiscation order, made after Masciopinto was jailed three years ago.

But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device. Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays. But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half. Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. \"The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. \"From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins. \"I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home. \"That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really.

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.",

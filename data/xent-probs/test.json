    "source": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\" This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama\". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably... my closest international partner these eight years\". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\" So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.",

    "source": "\"I am seriously considering emigrating to Australia, Jamaica or the US,\" says Faye Jones. The 32-year-old PA from Wokingham jumps every time there's a knock at the door and tiptoes around neighbours who might call the police. Her crime? Five years ago, Faye was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and after suffering from the side effects of prescribed drugs, she now uses cannabis to ease her pain, nausea and inflammation. In the UK, where cannabis is a Class B drug, police can issue warnings or on-the-spot fines for possession of a small amount, while courts can impose sentences of up to five years for possession of larger amounts and up to 14 years for those who supply or produce it. Faye - a campaigner for United Patients Alliance (UPA), which is calling for cannabis to be legally accessed by patients - has a raft of places she could start a new life. Medicinal cannabis is legal - or being legalised - in 25 US states, and in countries from Canada to Italy. \"But I'd rather not leave the country I was born in,\" she says. \"Mum would be devastated.\" Perhaps now she won't have to. A group of MPs has called on the government to legalise medical cannabis after publishing the results of a seven-month inquiry into medicinal use of the drug. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20,000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed. \"The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions,\" says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation. However, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies. It can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. A Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding: \"There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.\" Yet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons. By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online. After weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis. There is good evidence that it helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety. But for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that it works. Like any drug, cannabis can cause side effects. Smoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer. Regular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility. Cannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking. Cannabis affects how the brain works. It can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult to concentrate and learn. 37. average age of patient. 67%. try conventional medicines first. 37% don't tell their doctor. 72% buy street cannabis. 20% grow their own. The United Patients Alliance says 30% of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self-medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions. About a quarter of patients said they used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain. Almost 70% of the patients surveyed said they had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis. Doctors told Faye she would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of her life to deal with her rheumatoid arthritis. But after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and \"brain fog\", her job became untenable and her boss took her aside. \"I'd just bought a house and had a mortgage - I couldn't afford to lose my job,\" she says. Inspired by MS patients, she tried cannabis and now spends about \u00a3250 a month making her own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil. Faye says she takes the pills \"like I would ibuprofen, when I need them\", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make her high. Along with 38% of users surveyed by the APPG, she also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug. Fewer than a third smoke it with tobacco; one in five smokes it without tobacco. Others eat it, take capsules or use creams. MS patient Penny Fitzlyon, from London, said she was prescribed a variety of opiates which \"switched off all interest in the outside world\". She said they left her \"feeling grotty and miserable\", took away her sense of humour and made her constipated. \"Then after a second MRI scan, I overheard a nurse saying it wouldn't be long before I'd be in a wheelchair,\" she says. \"So I started doing my own research. Cannabis was the only thing I could find that hadn't killed anyone.\" Penny, 52, says she tracked down a herbalist who, unlike street sellers, knew how to mix different strains of cannabis for different patients. \"We want to get rid of street dealers,\" she says. \"Backstreet cannabis is not good - they mix it with sand or glass to make it look all sparkly and heavy.\" Some 72% of cannabis bought for medicinal use is purchased on the street or from friends, but 20% of users grow their own, in groups or by themselves. The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG. Penny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that she spends \u00a35,000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the \u00a330,000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, she says. Though she avoids \"getting stoned\", without small doses of the drug Penny finds simple tasks such as walking to the shops \"incredibly painful\". For Jon Liebling, from Reading, brushes with the law have only made him more determined to fight for the right to use cannabis as a medicine. A traumatic childhood, with a mother who attempted suicide and an absent father, left Jon anxious, depressed and struggling to concentrate at school. But after trying cannabis at university, he didn't look back. \"I knew it was illegal\", he says, \"But it just worked. All the pain and stress I'd carried in my back, shoulders and neck for years just went.\" But the 48-year-old's use of cannabis would see him arrested by the police three times - forcing him to leave university, drop out of a nurses' training course and finally land him in court for growing his own. Though the arrests led to no more than a slap on the wrist and a fine, he said they left him feeling \"angry and disenfranchised\". \"My life has been ruined by the law,\" he says. Now, as political director of the UPA, Jon says the conclusions of the parliamentary group are \"incredibly exciting\". \"I don't think judges really want to put people away for it,\" he says. \"I was really honest with the judge about my medical history and he was really sympathetic.\" Though Faye fears the police \"taking away her medicine\" or indeed sending her to prison, she says most people are \"very understanding\" - even potential employers. She says she has mentioned her End Our Pain campaigning in numerous job interviews \"and it never stopped me getting a second interview\". \"I'm cannabis proud,\" she says.",

In a statement, Newport city council said the pair were warned in 2010 that their company was not permitted to carry out turkey processing. However, it said records showed that large quantities of meat was sold by Severnside Provisions in 2011, 2012 and 2013. After an investigation started, environmental health officers found large quantities of turkey defrosting outside in dirty water and being processed in a garage in \"unhygienic conditions\". Items seized were destroyed but the Food Standards Agency launched a national recall after finding turkeys had already been sold to butchers' shops and restaurants. The council said O'Sullivan and Lincoln had admitted 12 food hygiene offences, including that they sold food that was unsafe and failed to keep equipment clean. As well as being jailed, the two directors were ordered to pay a confiscation award of \u00a3271,815 under the Proceeds of Crime Act and council costs of \u00a335,185. The company was also fined \u00a3100,000. Newport councillor Bob Poole said: \"This company was putting people's health at serious risk for the sake of profit.\"",

    "source": "They said the Chinese authorities had never before reported this to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). However, during the convention's standing committee meeting in Geneva, China reportedly said that it still banned tiger bones. \"A Chinese delegate said, 'we don't ban trade in tiger skins but we do ban trade in tiger bones,'\" a participant in the meeting said. Cites secretariat sources confirmed that a member of the Chinese delegation had said this. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told the BBC Chinese Service he could not verify the reported admission, but he said that China will \"investigate and combat\" any illegal trade in tiger skins. Between 5,000 and 6,000 tigers are believed to be in captivity in China. Wildlife conservation organisations have long demanded an end to the trade in skins. Wildlife experts believe \"tiger farming\" in China has fuelled demand for the poaching and trafficking of the endangered species elsewhere. They say the admission at the meeting will increase pressure on China to curb the practice. Reports also say that the facilities where the captive tigers are held have been providing live animals and parts for illegal international trade. According to officials and participants at the Cites meeting, the admission from China followed the presentation of a report which gave details of how the Chinese government had allowed commercial trade in skins from captive tigers. \"The report presented in the meeting created a situation that required China to respond,\" said a participant who did not wish to be named. \"Basically when the meeting focused on the findings of this report, the Chinese delegate intervened,\" he said. \"It was the first time they admitted officially that this trade exists in China.\" Participants say this created quite a sensation during the Cites meeting. \"After the Chinese intervention... we too intervened and made it clear that the investigations we have done with other organisations clearly show that the trade in China is happening on a commercial scale,\" said Shruti Suresh, a wildlife campaigner with the UK-based Environment Investigation Agency, which has investigated the illegal wildlife trade across the globe. \"The clarification was necessary because the Chinese delegate did not say that it was happening on a commercial scale, and there was a risk that the trade could later be misreported as something done for scientific research or, say, displays in the museums.\" Member countries of the Cites are required to report on what progress they have made to ensure that trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. A new report on illegal wildlife trade suggests that around 1,600 tigers, both from captivity and the wild, have been traded globally since 2000. While China has been a major market for tiger parts, wildlife experts say other South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia are also emerging as consumers, where tiger farming is growing. Reports say that in the past two years, there have been seizures of nearly 90 tigers likely to have been sourced from, or trafficked through, captive facilities across South East Asia and China. \"Demand-reduction efforts and enforcement and anti-trafficking activities are undermined both by the existence of facilities that keep and breed tigers for commercial purposes, and the lack of enforcement to stop trade from or through them,\" says a report by Species Survival Network (SSN), whose members include more than 100 wildlife conservation organisations. \"Trade in these specimens perpetuated the desirability of tiger parts and China's experiment in licensing the domestic trade in skins of captive tigers has done nothing to alleviate pressure on wild tigers, as evidenced through continued poaching in the wild.\" A little more than 3,000 tigers are believed to be left in the wild across the globe. More than half of those are in India, where 42 tigers were killed last year. \"If the Chinese government has admitted the trade in tiger skins, I think it is a forward step toward curbing illegal trade in tiger parts,\" said SP Yadav, deputy inspector general of India's National Tiger Conservation Authority. \"Denial mode does not help solve the problem but once you accept what is happening, it's easy to move ahead.\" The SSN report says the skins of tigers, leopards and snow leopards are valued among the political, military and business elite as luxury home decorations in China. \"The outcome of recent corruption cases in China confirm they are 'gifted' as non-financial bribes to officials,\" the report says. In 2005, China had announced that it was considering re-opening the domestic trade in tiger bone from tiger breeding facilities. Two years later, Cites parties adopted a decision calling for the phasing out of such facilities.",

    "source": "It also defied predictions that it would not survive the collapse of its one-time supporter, the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth $4-5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, he failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11.2 million. Area 110,860 sq km (42,803 sq miles) Major language Spanish. Major religion Christianity. Life expectancy 77 years (men), 81 years (women) Currency Cuban peso. Raul Castro, the world's longest-serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding his ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re-elected by the single-party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced his intention to stand down at the end of his second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. His beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned him iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been his brother's trusted right-hand man and was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under his leadership, Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where they defeated South Africa's army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as \"one of the world's worst countries from the viewpoint of journalists\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government\". Some key dates in Cuba's history:. 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008. 2014 - US President Barack Obama and President Castro announce moves to normalise diplomatic relations, severed for more than 50 years.",

    "source": "Batsman Root is the favourite to take over from Alastair Cook, who stepped down on Monday after a record 59 Tests. The Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015. \"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. Should he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012. No batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket. Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003. The 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007. \"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson. \"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. While they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. Root scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals. \"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said. \"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good. \"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\" Root has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended. He was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year. All-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood. \"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show. \"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\" Fast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness. \"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\" Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate. However, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series. Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting. \"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said. However, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries. Smith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations. \"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander. \"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one. \"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\" England and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy. The pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14. \"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme. \"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him. \"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

    "source": "The actor was charged with culpable homicide in Mumbai for the September 2002 incident. Mr Khan has always denied he was at the wheel. If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison. Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films. Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits. Late on the night of 28 September 2002, his Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say. The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries. The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car. But many witnesses have said that was not the case. A constable attached to Mr Khan's security said in a statement to the police that the \"drunk\" actor had lost control of the car. The policeman died in 2007 of tuberculosis. In April, Mr Khan's driver told the court that he had crashed the car after a tyre burst. At the scene, Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Mumbai. It's not uncommon most days to find people camped outside the house of Salman Khan hoping for a glimpse of the star. But on Wednesday morning dozens of journalists and fans gathered as they waited for the actor to leave on the way to court. Even Mr Khan's father was ambushed as he went on a morning stroll along the seafront encircled by security guards - proof this is a case that has gripped Bollywood and wider India.",

And it was the Frontier Corps which found itself at the forefront of the violent tremors which flattened much of the town. Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Arif is the officer in charge of the area, and saw his headquarters collapse before his eyes. \"My residence is on a small hill. From there, I saw the shockwave ripping through the town and destroying houses with it.\" \"It was a terrible sight which I can never forget.\" Officials estimate that about 80% of the houses in the Mashkel area collapsed - either partially or completely - in the quake. Army helicopters have been delivering tents from the provincial capital, Quetta. But we saw family after family sitting amid the ruins of their mud-brick houses under open skies with no shelter. Mashkel social worker Lareef Baloch says that most houses in the town are uninhabitable. \"The structures still standing are dangerous because they have cracks in them,\" he told the BBC. \"We see army helicopters flying in and out of town, but we haven't received any tents, blankets, medicines or food.\" The relief operation has been hampered by the remoteness of the affected area. The road journey from Quetta to Mashkel is long and dangerous. Since Tuesday, small aftershocks have continued to hit the area. One survivor told the BBC that he was traumatised by the experience and now has difficulty sleeping at night. The Pakistani army says it has tried its best in the rescue and relief effort. But an army spokesman told the BBC that people of the area will need help from national and international aid groups in the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in the weeks ahead. It could be that ties on the ground will also play a role in providing help to quake victims. Residents of Mashkel have close ties with ethnic Balochs in Iran's Sistan province. Many people have families and relatives on both sides of the border. The town's economy depends on oil smuggling from Iran and the annual date harvest. The BBC saw several vehicles with Iranian registration plates being used to transport people on sandy tracks. When the earthquake struck this week, many people preferred to take their injured across the border to the city of Zahidan in Sistan province. The Iranian authorities were quick to relax border movements to facilitate the relief effort. The road journey from Mashkel to Zahidan takes a few hours, compared with  the 15 to 18 hours it takes to reach Balochistan's capital, Quetta. So far, one of the few Islamic charities that has managed to reach the remote town is  Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The group, considered close the Pakistani army, is led by Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the banned jihadist outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba.",

    "source": "Many developing countries will try to curb carbon emissions by setting aside forested areas as reserves. But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas. The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded:. \"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights,\" said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. \"It could result in the displacement of millions of people.\" Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. \"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result,\" said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. \"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years. \"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist.\" Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (\u00c2\u00a3137m) to more than \u00c2\u00a31bn. The main argument for setting up reserves is to:. And Mr White said: \"We need to make evidence available that makes it clear that the woods are full of people, and it makes more sense to help them rather than kick them out. \"Where indigenous peoples rights are protected, and they are able to use their forests for their own livelihoods, they have more carbon per hectare than protected areas. \"They are active protectors, you don't have to pay a park guard, because they protect their forests, and that is what the world needs.\" Some 1.5 billion indigenous people inhabit or claim most of the land in the world - but, according to a study released last year, they have legal rights to just 10%.

    "source": "The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy. The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government. The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020. The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:. Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do. Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour. It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election. Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy. More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this. An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections. In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",

Celtic assistant Chris Davies confirmed on Monday that his club maintain \"a constant dialogue\" with Roberts. \"There is always going to be a home for him here if that suits everybody,\" Davies said. \"They have been talking and the situation is always open to a certain extent because the transfer window is still open. \"We've got the players that are with us working and fighting right now, we've been scoring and creating goals, so if something extra happens then it's all positive, but if not, we're OK.\" Media playback is not supported on this device. Nice, who face Napoli in the Champions League play-off round, have already added two players to their midfield options this week, with Wesley Sneijder, previously of Galatasaray, signing on Tuesday following the acquisition of Allan Saint-Maximin from Lique 1 rivals Monaco. But Roberts is ready to tell his parent club that his own choice would be Celtic. \"All I know from our part is that we value the player, rate the player, and I'm sure if it was right for everybody then something would be done,\" said Davies. \"But we can't really control that at the moment. We just focus on our work here and see how that one evolves. \"Pat at the moment is playing for Man City, he's featured for them, so I can't comment too much on it.\" Davies also confirmed there were no plans to bring in an extra central defender despite injuries to Dedryck Boyata and Erik Sviatchenko ahead of facing Astana of Kazakhstan over two legs on 16 and 22 August for a place in the Champions League group stage. Before then, Celtic face Kilmarnock in the League Cup on Tuesday then travel to take on Partick Thistle in the Premiership. \"We've used Nir Bitton, who has played there before and done exceptionally well,\" said Davies. \"Kristoffer Ajer has filled in and Mikael Lustig can fill in as well - and we've got Jozo Simunovic. \"We're happy with what we've got going into tomorrow night. Astana is coming up, but we're comfortable. \"We're not in a desperate situation, we're comfortable and we've got six games coming up in the next 20 days, so we've got a squad we're going to have to use and everybody has to be ready.\" Englishman Davies also confirmed that Celtic are talking to former winger Shaun Maloney over a coaching role at the club. The 34-year-old began his career at Celtic Park, making more than 150 appearances for the Scottish champions, and the player is expected to retire after his proposed summer move to Aberdeen after leaving Hull City fell through because of persistent injuries. \"I can't give you anything definitive - it's something the club are looking at,\" Davies said. \"I've met him once or twice and been really impressed with him as a character and his thoughts on the game. \"He brings a lot of experience as a player and his Celtic connections as well. \"I think he would fit in really well if it were to happen. Any player that's been involved at a club as a player, especially if they've come through the academy, it gives them a good empathy for the players in that academy.\"",

Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. \"Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal,\" chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors. Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50%. Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities. Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit. Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles. A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February. On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles. Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found. Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company.",

Ministers have been talking to Labour MPs to try to persuade them to back intervention ahead of a Commons vote expected by Christmas. Mr Corbyn is against military action, but a number of his MPs support it and may rebel if ordered to vote against. On his first visit to Wales as party leader, Mr Corbyn said the priority should be a political settlement in the war-torn country, in order to \"isolate\" so-called Islamic State. Asked whether he would allow his MPs a free vote - which means they would not have to follow the chosen party line - he said: \"No, we would have to consider it as a party, consider it as a group and decide how we would react at that point, I can't predict at this stage.\" Events in Syria are \"beyond appalling\" he said, adding that \"there has to be a political solution - all wars end with a political solution\". Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed suggestions a UN resolution - which Labour is calling for - would be needed before the UK takes action in Syria. MPs rejected air strikes on Syria in 2013, when the target was President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, but later approved British participation in air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq. The BBC has been told ministers are increasingly confident they will have the numbers to secure Commons backing to extend the campaign into Syria. Mr Cameron has said he will set out a detailed case for intervention and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is planning to brief Labour MPs collectively at an open meeting.

    "source": "The UK Renewable Energy Roadmap says measures being introduced will \"ensure that low-carbon electricity from a diverse range of sources... becomes a more attractive choice for investors, delivering long-term change while minimising cost to the consumer\". In its UK Bioenergy Strategy, published in April 2012, the coalition government placed high importance on the role biomass can play, warning that excluding it from the energy mix would \"significantly increase the cost of decarbonising our energy system - an increase estimated by recent analysis at \u00c2\u00a344bn\". However, it added that ministers had a responsibility to ensure that \"policies only supported bioenergy use in the right circumstances\". The strategy document outlined four guiding principles that would underpin policy decisions, one of which stated:. The UK introduced the Climate Change Act 2008, which obliges governments to deliver an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emission from 1990 levels by 2050. Experts agree that in order for this target to be met, the UK's energy infrastructure must drastically cut its carbon footprint. Outdoor laboratory. In a Lincolnshire field, a team of scientists led by researchers from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) carried out a range of experiments on two bioenergy crops: miscanthus grass and short-rotation coppice willow. Natural England's guide to miscanthus (PDF) In their outdoor laboratory, they set out to measure how much atmospheric carbon the crops were able to lock in the soil. \"The big barrier as far as bioenergy crops are concerned is a fear of the unknown in terms of soil carbon losses or gains - this is the gap we are trying to fill,\" explained lead researcher Niall McNamara. \"At this field site, we are very lucky to have two key bioenergy crops growing side-by-side, which is allowing us to make a comparison of their effects on soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from the soil,\" he told BBC News. One of the experiments involves erecting three-metre high tents over a section of the crops, allowing the team to expose the plants to a \"carbon tracer\" - a form of carbon that is different from atmospheric carbon so it is possible for the researchers to track its movements from the surrounding air, through the plants and into the soil. \"This is added through the tent for about four to five hours,\" said Dr McNamara. \"During this time, it is fixed by the plants through photosynthesis. We then follow that carbon which has been fixed by the plant into the soil and into the microbes and back out of the soil.\" He added that the experiment would provide data on how novel crops, such as miscanthus, introduced carbon into the soil and how stable it was once it was in the ground. \"As you can see, miscanthus is very different from anything you would see normally,\" he observed. \"It originates from Asia and so there has not been a lot of work done on it and the carbon tracer approach is a very good way of seeing how much carbon fixed by the plant will stay in the soil a year later.\" Another experiment the team are carrying out involves taking a metre-deep soil sample, which co-researcher Rebecca Rowe describes as \"quite unusual\". \"A lot of soil science, at the moment, is done to about 30cm, partly for practical reasons as coring to a metre is difficult,\" she said. Digging deep. In order to extract the metre-long sample, the team have to enlist the help of \"Kevin\", an adapted road-breaker. \"Also because a lot of arable crops or grassland crops the rooting depths are much shallower, a lot of the changes are happening in the top 30cm,\" Dr Rowe told BBC News. \"Obviously, with energy crops that are in the ground for 20-25 years, we are looking at a lot longer timescale and a greater depth for rooting so it is important for us to go deeper.\" Dr Rowe is 12 months into a three-year project that involves collecting metre soil samples all over the UK. \"We could just do it here at our Lincolnshire site, but then we would only be able to say what is happening with soil carbon in this location in this soil type,\" she explained. \"By going all over the country, we can look at different soil types and different climates - the South-West is very different  to, say, southern Scotland. \"It gives us a much better idea of what the overall effect on soil carbon may be in all of the sites across the UK with growing things like willow, miscanthus and different arable crops as well.\" (Source: UK Bioenergy Strategy) Dr McNamara said the data would be used to develop a model, developed by researchers from Aberdeen University and other partners, to show how growing bioenergy crops would affect an area of land's soil carbon characteristics. \"Our plan is to make a model universally available to the community, so a user could download our model and then - for example - predict what would happen if they converted their land to bioenergy crops in terms of the implication for soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. The project - commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute, with additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council - would, Dr McNamara added, help address the concern over the scarcity of data on bioenergy crops and carbon cycling, and allow policymakers make informed decisions about the role bioenergy can play in delivering a low carbon UK energy mix.",

The charity was set up by leading businessman and philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter. Tickets for a table of 10 at the dinner are expected to go on sale for approximately \u00c2\u00a35,000. The Hunter Foundation has previously arranged for US politicians and actors including Bill Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to come to Scotland. Last year, Leonardo DiCaprio travelled to Edinburgh to speak at the Scottish Business Awards at the EICC. He also visited Home, a restaurant in Queensferry Street, which gives its profits to the homeless. Hundreds of fans were waiting for his arrival. Many had queued in the rain for hours. The previous year, George Clooney visited Social Bite in Rose Street. The actor visited the cafe, which donates all its profits to homeless people, leaving $1,000 (about \u00c2\u00a3650) for the cause. He stayed at the cafe for around 15 minutes, and greeted the 200-strong crowd who were waiting outside. Mr Clooney shook hands, posed for selfies and chatted with fans. All of the cash raised will be split between children's charities in Scotland and the Obama Foundation, set up by the former president and his wife Michelle. Sir Tom also plans to set aside some seats at the event for local young people. He said: \"From the South Side of Chicago to the White House has been an epic, historic journey and it will be a true honour to hear that story from the man who made that journey. \"We are both truly proud and delighted to be hosting the 44th president of the United States in Scotland at this event.\" Sir Tom told the Press Association he is \"really chuffed\" Mr Obama is coming to Scotland. \"We're always looking for really inspiring speakers to come along to Scotland, and really inspire and inform,\" Sir Tom said. \"To be able to get president Obama, we're really chuffed.\" The entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist also revealed he is planning a special surprise for the 44th US president. He said: \"President Obama loves his music, so we're getting some interesting guests.\" Speaking from New York as she continued her five-day visit to the US, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she was \"really excited\" about the announcement.

I'd be so disgusted if my child acted they way those youths did.\" A Merseyside Police spokesman said it was investigating a report of anti-social behaviour by a group of youths at the event.",

    "source": "Leonie Granger from Gillingham, Kent, was sentenced at the Old Bailey having been found guilty of manslaughter. Her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson, 28, and his friend Nicholas Chandler, 29, were found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Granger targeted Mehmet Hassan, 56, in a Mayfair casino in March last year. Judge William Kennedy described the attack as \"pitiless and wicked\", adding: \"It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.\" Granger's lawyer Orlando Pownall said she only took part in the plot as she was in love with Jackson and \"fell in with his desires\" and now \"deeply regretted\" her actions. \"Her head was turned by Jackson, who she loved, and to some extent by Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming,\" he said. But Judge Kennedy said she had been \"deceitful from the outset\" and had \"lost her sense and compassion\" when she got involved. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, who posed under the name of Rachel, was wined and dined by the divorced father of three who boasted to friends he was not paying her to be with him, the court heard earlier. On the night he was killed, Mr Hassan had taken Granger to the upmarket Nobu restaurant before giving her \u00c2\u00a31,000 to gamble with at the nearby Palm Beach Casino. The two were seen kissing passionately by a poker supervisor, before leaving the casino together for Mr Hassan's flat in Islington. Granger then let Jackson and Chandler into the poker player's flat before leaving in a taxi. Both men tied up Mr Hassan with parcel tape and a neck tie before kicking and stamping him to death, the trial was told. Afterwards, while he lay dead in a pool of blood, all three were filmed on Granger's mobile phone throwing \u00c2\u00a350 notes around a room and even stuffing  them in their underpants. Commenting on the footage, Judge Kennedy told the three defendants: \"The eloquence with which it speaks about you is deafening.\"",

    "source": "Surprise frontrunner Francois Fillon said his project was \"more radical\", and vowed to implement sweeping changes in the first three months of his term. Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were \"deep and credible\" but lacked the \"brutality\" of Mr Fillon's plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday's concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self-declared supporters of the centre-right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. It is the party's first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44.1% to Mr Juppe's 28.5%. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives. Press review: France's 'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon. Fillon under fire over women's rights. The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71% of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57% of viewers of all political stripes. \"It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn (\u00c2\u00a385bn; $106bn). \"I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was \"on the brink of revolt\", which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate \"eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders \"have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the \"vicious cycle of spending and debt\". They have \"some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor\", concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing \"significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to \"respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a \"powerful EU as a future world power\". On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France \"back in play\" by \"opening a channel to Damascus\", whereas Mr Juppe wants to \"boost transatlantic co-operation\" and takes a firm line against President Bashar al-Assad, Le Monde says. Left-wing Liberation writes that the debate between \"Fillon the radical and Juppe the reconciler\" was \"knotty, often tense, but not aggressive\". It thought Mr Juppe managed to score points over his opponent on some issues, but \"not enough to trouble the winner of the first round\". BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook. Mr Juppe hit back at Mr Fillon, saying \"reform should not be a punishment but bring hope\". \"The French social model exists, I want to consolidate it... not break it,\" Mr Juppe said, referring to the welfare system. Mr Juppe pledged to bring unity and stability to the presidency - whose current Socialist incumbent, Francois Hollande, has seen his popularity drop to historic lows. He said he would choose a \"loyal\" PM and 15 \"durable\" cabinet ministers who would not \"change every 18 months\".",

He then broke down in tears as he dedicated his award to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. The musician spent his early 20s living in the city, and busked on the metro as a struggling musician. He told BBC News he had returned to Paris last weekend to support friends who had been caught up in the tragedy. Reflecting on the Mercury Prize, he said: \"I always believed in my music but after Paris happened, I was very down. \"I didn't think I would win. I always wanted to be nominated for this award, but I didn't think to myself that I'd win it.

It touches on his turbulent upbringing in Edmonton, London, as well as the three years he spent sleeping rough in Paris. \"I made this album thinking only about 50 people would listen to it,\" he told the BBC. \"My music isn't mainstream music. \"It goes to show that you've just got to be sincere in your work and people will listen to it.\" The Mercury Prize recognises innovative albums produced in the UK and Ireland.

It's not something where your big artists come in and scoop up all the gongs. It could be anybody's.\" A panel of 12 musicians, broadcasters and music writers selected the winner, casting their final votes on the night of the award ceremony. The jury included former nominee Corinne Bailey Rae, who said the decision came \"really close to the wire\".

The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States. Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers. A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force. What happened in Ferguson in 2014? US Dept of Justice report on Ferguson racism. Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago. At the end of a sombre, peaceful day of commemorations, shots were heard at about 23:15 local time on Sunday (04:15 Monday GMT) as a large crowd gathered on West Florissant Avenue,. St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that after \"an exchange of gunfire between two groups\" the suspect, believed by police to be armed, left and encountered officers in an unmarked SUV. He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle.

Sergeant Seydou Kon\u00e9 said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (\u00a36,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouak\u00e9 to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Kon\u00e9 said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, had threatened \"severe disciplinary sanctions\" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouak\u00e9, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouak\u00e9 in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council.

Jaysh al-Islam said the pilot was captured by militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, who were supposed to hand him over but killed him instead.

It was believed the Irish Army had removed all the wreckage at the time but a group of aviation historians and Queens University Belfast archaeologists thought otherwise. After ground surveys pointed to parts being present just four metres below the surface, a number of items were excavated on Saturday. These included the cockpit door. The pilot - Gordon Hayter Proctor - had safely bailed out of the plane on the northern side of the border after his instruments froze. It glided on before crashing in a field in Figullar, Emyvale, on 20 November 1942. The plane, which had seen action in the Battle of Britain, was considered \"war-weary\" and had been assigned to a weather-monitoring squadron operating out of RAF Aldergrove in Antrim in 1942. Project organiser Jonny McNee told the BBC the dig had \"exceeded expectations\" and they had recovered \"Monaghan's Battle of Britain forgotten heritage\". The aviation historian said they had unearthed internal parts of the Rolls-Royce engine and plates inscribed with information, such as manufacturing details. \"The cockpit door was a bit of a surprise,\" he said. \"The last person to use it was Flt Lt Gordon Hayter Proctor who was later declared missing while serving in Burma. \"He has no grave and now he will be remembered in a bit of Monaghan. The display will be homage to him.\" He added that the team would love to make contact with any of his family members. Mr McNee said they knew more than 90% of the plane had been taken away at the time and probably scrapped. \"We had done our research and by looking at the Irish Army military archives, we knew that a substantial amount of the plane was taken away,\" he said. \"Back in September we applied for and were granted a licence to use ground-penetrating radar which detected the impact crater and showed sizable metallic remains.\" Pupils from three schools - two in Monaghan and one in County Londonderry - had been invited to help out at the dig, which also attracted the attention of many locals. Josie McCusker, who remembers seeing the Spitfire fall from the sky all those years ago, stayed for the entire duration of the dig. \"It was the morning, a Sunday morning and I remember the loud noise of it,\" she told BBC Radio Ulster. \"My father was milking cows in the byre and he heard the noise and he ran into the house thinking it was on fire. \"We then discovered it was a plane - it took the tops off the trees and a piece of it fell down in a gooseberry bush behind the house. \"I remember much of the plane being removed by the Army, and remember seeing it on a lorry.\" The job now is to clean, sort, identify and catalogue the items before handing them to the County Monaghan Museum, which will then be able to claim it has artefacts from the only Battle of Britain Spitfire to be legally excavated in Ireland.",

A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion. A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said. According to TMZ, which broke the story, police believe the seven-time Grand Slam champion was at fault. But a lawyer for Williams said it was an \"unfortunate accident\". The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the accident happened. Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. \"[Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver],\" the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions. The 37-year-old tennis star reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. Police spokesman Major Paul Rogers said police were investigating whether the incident was connected to Mr Barson's death. Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: \"Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. \"Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one.\" Next week, Williams is due to play at Wimbledon in London, where she is seeded 10th.",

The move was set in motion in 2013 with a law that fully legalised the cannabis trade. However, it has been a slow process to put the law into practice. \"Cannabis will be dispensed in pharmacies starting in the month of July,\" presidential aide Juan Andres Roballo told a press conference. The law requires buyers to sign up to a national registry, which Mr Roballo said would be up and running by 2 May. The price will be US$1.30 (\u00a31) per gram. Registrants - who must be Uruguayan citizens or permanent residents - can purchase up to a maximum of 40 grams (1.4 ounces) per month. The marijuana sold will come from state-supervised fields. The law also allows users to grow their own at home, or join  cooperative clubs that farm it. Many pharmacists have doubted the financial benefits of selling a cost-controlled product. Some Uruguayan buyers were also reluctant to sign up to a national registry, complaining of the invasion of their privacy and of having to keep to the monthly limits. The government has now done a deal with 16 pharmacies, but it hopes to sign up more. Mr Roballo said there would be a public health campaign before the registry was opened. He also said the government was not close to covering the predicted demand, but it does not believe there will be \"an avalanche of users\" signing up,.",

Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europe now had to \"fight for its own destiny\". Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September. \"The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days,\" Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: \"We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands.\" On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as \"very unsatisfactory\". Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week. Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change. Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees. Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September. It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd. But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them. Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny. No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business. With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party. She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September.",

    "source": "David Jones told MPs Tories campaigned in the 2015 general election on the basis of a referendum and not having one would be \"disrespectful\" to people. But current Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said \"devolution has moved forward\" since the election. Significant powers had been handed to Scotland and councils, he added. MPs were debating the UK government's Wales Bill - to transfer further powers from Westminster to Cardiff Bay. Earlier another Conservative, Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies, had told BBC Wales he could \"see my first rebellion against the government will be coming\" over the referendum issue. Asked if other Tory MPs would join him in a rebellion, he said: \"I personally feel there will be.\" Addressing Mr Cairns in the Commons later Mr Davies he said he was \"personally very disappointed that in this clause we have broken a manifesto commitment and I would ask if you, who stood on the same manifesto, are equally as disappointed that you are breaking this commitment?\" Mr Cairns replied: \"First of all it was the 2014 [Government of Wales] Act that devolved tax varying powers to the assembly. \"This bill will go one step further by removing the requirement for a referendum. \"But what I would say - the second point I would say - is that devolution has moved forward since that time and we can either seek to have the hollow argument about rowing back or we can make the Welsh Government more accountable, more responsible for the money which it raises.\" Later Clwyd West MP Mr Jones intervened: \"Is it not the case that only just over 12 months ago the Conservative Party fought on a manifesto which pledged that there would be a referendum before any tax carrying competence was devolved to the assembly?\" Mr Cairns responded: \"You will recognise how quickly the devolution make up of the UK has developed, evolved and matured over that time. \"And this is the next logical step to making an assembly more mature, to making it more responsible, but ultimately making it more accountable to the people of Wales.\" Opening the debate , the minister said the Wales Bill would \"end the squabbles between Cardiff Bay and Westminster\". He later confirmed AMs would also be able to make voting in assembly elections compulsory, a power transfer welcomed by Labour Ynys Mon MP Albert Owen as \"radical\" and \"excellent\". Mr Davies wrote a letter to the Chancellor George Osborne with Tory backbench colleagues Byron Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones after his Autumn Statement in November urging him to reverse plans to devolve the tax powers without a referendum. Under existing law AMs can call a referendum on powers to vary income tax, but in 2015 Mr Osborne offered those powers without a referendum. The Wales Bill also makes substantial changes to the way the assembly makes law by defining, for the first time, the areas that are in the hands of Westminster. It also grants new powers for AMs and Welsh ministers, including speed limits, control over fracking, the name of the assembly and elections to the Senedd. The bill has been revised from its previous draft form with more powers being devolved than planned.",

    "source": "More than 60 years on, with another World Cup looming in Brazil and the Indian economy booming, there are renewed hopes that football can finally gain a toehold in the cricket-loving country. Qualification for the 2014 World Cup may be a step too far, but there are a number of initiatives under way to boost the sport. The challenges are to nurture that growing interest while wooing fans away from watching overseas football on TV,  and the need to create a strong national league and international team. Off the pitch there is the need to build football industry and infrastructure, while boosting the expertise of administrators and coaching and other backroom staff. \"There is a challenge from cricket, which gets the most investment,\" admits Kushal Das, general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). \"Many youngsters though are now watching a lot of football, mainly European leagues. \"We need to develop interest in the Indian leagues, and we need development programmes for that.\" Mr Das said he was encouraged by the recent visit of Fifa president Sepp Blatter to the country. The country is hoping to host the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, and Mr Blatter has so far offered encouraging noises. Mr Das said that highlights over the past couple of years included India playing in the AFC Asian Cup in 2011 for the first time in more than 20 years, and the 15-year commercial and marketing partnership between the AIFF and IMG-Reliance. Encouragement has also come from a recent development plan for football in India drawn up with Fifa. \"We are starting up academies for player development in four cities by July and another four by July 2013, for different age groups,\" says Mr Das. A technical director has also been appointed for the first time, unusual as it may seem that such a role did not exist before. \"We are looking not just at player development, but also administration, education, referees,\" says Mr Das. \"If we are successful in hosting the Under-17 there will be [business] opportunities, to participate in the whole development of Indian football - it is a great opportunity.\" He adds: \"The biggest challenge is infrastructure. I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\" IMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017. One of the footballing hotbeds in the country is Pune, a city in the west of the country with a three million-plus population. \"Sport, including football, is tremendously popular among the youth of our city today,\" says Vishwajeet Kadam,  president of Pune District Football Association. \"We don't only focus on the skills development of players. We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\" Pune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city. \"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam. \"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market. \"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\" One club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children. Mario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days. \"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support. \"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\" Business bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football. Rajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise. \"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure. \"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football. \"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\" IMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF. \"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack. Mr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\". He adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from an\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 organisation standpoint. \"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work. \"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand. Football needs to succeed. It needs a plan. We are are not there yet. \"But the long term view we have is that this will be lucrative.\" Meanwhile, uncertainty remains about the future of the proposed, but currently delayed, Premier Soccer League (PLS) in West Bengal. The PLS was intended as a state league for older European players - such as Robert Pires and Fabio Cannavaro. It attracted publicity around the world, particularly in the UK. Mr Slack said he understood the premise of the league as, he says, India is a country that is \"star driven\". But he said there was a pressing need to boost the status of the current Indian national soccer league. \"We are in dialogue with I-League about how to make the league more competitive and attractive,\" he says. \"There are no easy solutions there. We completely understand that the clubs need to get more out of it.\"",

    "source": "John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained \"absolutely committed\" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. \"Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',\" he said. \"Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. \"Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. \"I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people.\" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were \"not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament\". And they said the legislation made it \"perfectly possible\" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a \"wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware\". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed.",

Serious or repeat offences can now be punished by a points deduction, expulsion or relegation. Jeffrey Webb, head of Fifa's anti-racism task force, said the decision was \"a defining moment\". He added: \"Our football family is fully aware that what is reported in the media is actually less than 1% of the incidents that happen around the world. \"We've got to take action so that when we look to the next 20 or 50 years this will be the defining time that we took action against racism and discrimination.\" Fifa, world football's governing body, passed the anti-racism resolution with a 99% majority at its congress in Mauritius. Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. \"Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules,\" he said. \"Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism.\" Webb said of the vote against the measures: \"I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way.\" Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: \"We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. \"We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up.\" Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. \"You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism,\" he told Radio 5 live. \"To me, racism is racism. \"Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from. Any form of racism is serious enough for the bans to start, they should hit people hard straight away.\"",

Napolioni Nalaga plundered two tries to see Clermont pull away and home legend Aurelien Rougerie scored from halfway to secure the four-try bonus point. With three of last year's semi-finalists alongside the Sharks in Pool One the Salford-based side were always going to be big outsiders to qualify, and with a solitary point from two games the knock-out stages look impossible now. They enjoyed some good moments, with David Seymour a constant menace at the breakdown, but ultimately the hosts had too much power and class. Fly-half Cipriani, playing his first game since being left out of the England squad, mixed lovely touches with a couple of careless mistakes, but along with the rest of his side he was powerless to prevent the Clermont onslaught after the break. Despite trailing by 10 points at the interval Sale were competitive in the first half and it took a poor throw at the line-out - far from the last unfortunately for the visitors - to spark Clermont into life. Wales centre Jonathan Davies - who immediately went off with a reported shoulder injury - chipped and regathered before feeding Abendanon, who scooted down the line and produced a piston-like hand-off on Sale scrum-half Will Cliff to score. Lopez, 25, converted and added two penalties after Cipriani's solitary reply for Sale as the hosts edged clear. After the break Clermont grew more dominant by the minute and added a second try when the giant Nalaga claimed Lopez's cross-kick and stepped inside two covering defenders to score. The Fijian powerhouse added a second with 10 minutes remaining after a flowing passing move and, with the passionate home fans demanding a fourth try, the 34-year-old Rougerie dummied on halfway, handed off Tom Arscott and outpaced the Sale defence to score in the corner.

Suspect Jaber al-Bakr gave elite commandos the slip over the weekend, sparking a two-day manhunt. Police believe Mr Bakr was planning to bomb a Berlin airport. The country's best-selling daily newspaper Bild dubbed the refugee trio the \"Syrian heroes of Leipzig\". Politicians from across the spectrum recommended them for the Federal Cross of Merit, a rank in Germany's civilian honours system. Ansgar Heveling, chairman of the parliamentary committee on interior affairs, went a step further and called on them to be granted asylum. Fellow Syrian refugees have also taken to social media to praise their compatriots. Police had been watching Mr Bakr, 22, for months, but he evaded police surveillance on Saturday in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, just as the authorities were preparing to storm an apartment where he was staying. Mr Bakr, who is also Syrian, made his way south to Leipzig and asked for help and shelter from the trio, who later recognised Mr Bakr as a suspect after seeing police's appeals for information in Arabic on Facebook. They quickly overpowered the fugitive, tied him up, and called police. \"I was furious with him, I couldn't accept something like this - especially here in Germany, the country that opened its doors to us,\" one of the men told RTL Television. The three have not been identifying over fear of reprisals. A little more than 200,000 people arrived in Germany to seek asylum in the first nine months of this year - a significant reduction from 2015, the country's interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said. Last year, 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in the country, less than the one million originally estimated.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. With all the results now declared, Jac Larner of Cardiff University sums up the night for Wales' five main parties. WELSH LABOUR. Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES. The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU. It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP. UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.",

    "source": "It is a talent that helped him move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time he was 48. Along the way he created and sold best-selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high-profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco. Now 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on his farm, the serial entrepreneur says: \"People love stories, the real stories behind things. \"And the media was very important to me from the first days of Tyrrells. \"I was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\" The son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from his dad when he was 20 after he \"managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend me \u00a3200,000\". As the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant he couldn't harvest his crop, which he had to leave to rot in the fields. Overextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" After \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again. This time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets. Yet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\". He adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\" Mr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle. At the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand. Despite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand. So he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Returning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later. Quick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps. He says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for \u00a31 and they would retail them for \u00a32. For us the net profit was 35%.\" Supermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices. Then one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price. An incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down. With sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting \u00a314m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business. Mr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment. \"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\" Unhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost \u00a340m. Looking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka. So with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born. Aimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for \u00a335 a bottle. While Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales. And showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made. Also now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week. Mr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand. But there has to be real DNA behind it if you want to be successful.\"",

    "source": "In a series of Twitter posts addressed directly to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro also called him a \"petty dictator\". Mr Maduro accused the OAS chief earlier this week of being a CIA agent and a traitor himself. The Venezuelan president has blamed his country's economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co-ordinated from the US. During a three-hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified his declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA. He then told journalists: \"Almagro, just give up. He has been a traitor for a long time... At some point I will tell his story, I know his secrets. The Americans, the CIA, have played a master move using Almagro as their agent.\" Mr Almagro, who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay, had already clashed with Mr Maduro last year after he called him \"rubbish\". Mr Almagro had responded on that occasion with an eight-page open letter, saying he would be \"rubbish\" if he ignored the plight of the Venezuelan people. His Twitter posts this week were both more concise and more direct. Linking to his open letter to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro said: @NicolasMaduro I'm not a traitor either to my ideas or my principles BUT YOU ARE A TRAITOR to your people. In a series of 12 tweets, he also told the Venezuelan president that \"you will NEVER be able to undo so much suffering, intimidation, misery and anguish you've created for your people\". He also said Mr Maduro would \"NEVER be able to bring back to life the children who've died because of lack of medicine\". Venezuelan doctors say a shortage of essential medicine has reached a crisis point. Mr Almagro also urged Mr Maduro to allow a recall referendum to go ahead. Opposition politicians have handed in a petition with 1.85 million signatures to the electoral authorities requesting a referendum be held to recall Mr Maduro from office. But Mr Maduro's deputy, Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were \"fraudulent\". Mr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro \"another petty dictator\". While President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro's tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did. She wrote, \"Mr Almagro, every time you make a statement you express your hatred against Venezuela and its legitimate authorities. You are part of the imperialist detritus.\" \"You only repeat the scripted words which your imperialist masters dictate to you\". \"You will never give orders to Venezuela!\" The former president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, has also commented on the row between Mr Almagro, who served as Mr Mujica's foreign minister, and President Maduro. Asked what he made of the bitter exchange, he said using a popular Spanish saying that Mr Maduro was \"crazy as a goat\". \"They're all crazy in Venezuela, they call each other all sorts of things but they're not going to fix anything this way.\" While Mr Mujica is known for his direct and outspoken manner his words are damaging to Mr Maduro, who has always praised the former left-wing president as a \"comrade\".",

It was also number one in many other countries and won the Ivor Novello award for best song composition. He died peacefully after a six-year battle with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a family statement said. The statement said his closest family were \"with him to the last\" and that many people would miss his songs and his music. Where Do You Go To (My Lovely), a song about a girl born in poverty who becomes a member of the European jet-set, was replaced as number one by Marvin Gaye's I Heard it Through the Grapevine. It was included in the compilation programme One-Hit Wonders at the BBC, which was broadcast on BBC Four last year, although Sarstedt also reached number 10 in the charts with Frozen Orange Juice in June 1969. He wrote more than a dozen albums in a career that spanned more than 50 years, releasing his last, Restless Heart, in 2013. Born into a musical family in India, Sarstedt was one of three brothers who all enjoyed success in the UK singles chart. His older sibling, Richard Sarstedt, who performed under the stage name Eden Kane, also topped the charts with Well I ask You in 1961, while younger brother Clive, performing under the name Robin Sarstedt, reached number three in 1976 with My Resistance is Low. Sarstedt's music reached new audiences when Where Do You Go To (My Lovely) was included in the Wes Anderson films Hotel Chevalier and The Darjeeling Limited, which were both released in 2007. According to his website, he retired in 2010 because of his illness - a rare, progressive neurological condition.",

    "source": "New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before. Savings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis. Since last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again. Tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points. In research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year. While low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills. \"There's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings. \"Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore. The pot's disappearing.\" Fellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care. \"It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me,\" she says, \"There are a lot of us to be looked after.\" The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society. The average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%. Tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%. Another Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. \"It's worrying,\" she says. \"I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more.\" Some rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer. First Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending. \"The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market,\" she explains, \"They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact.\" A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years. \"While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear.\" The looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again. Behind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\", given the precarious economic situation across the world.",

Sightseers have been warned to stay away from the scene of the grounding, and a 300m temporary exclusion zone has been put in place around Dalmore beach. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was necessary to keep roads clear. The rig, which is carrying 280 tonnes of diesel oil, broke free from its tug during towing and severe weather prevented the line being reconnected. A salvage team began an inspection of the structure on Tuesday in preparation for the more detailed assessment. Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, said the initial survey was to check \"a number of things including fuel tanks\". Officials said the aim was to carry-out as much work as possible on Wednesday while the weather was favourable, but warned that work to refloat the rig could take some time. Mark Rodaway, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said it was necessary to keep roads clear for emergency crews and salvage teams. He said: \"We understand that this incident is of interest to people living in the area but we're asking them to stay away to ensure easy access for emergency services and salvage teams. \"Also the last thing we want is for people to be injured or worse trying to get a closer look on remote cliff paths.\" Three vessels including the emergency towing vessel Herakles are the scene of the grounding. Union Bear, a multipurpose offshore vessel, has also arrived at Stornoway Harbour from Aberdeen to assist in the salvage operation. There were no personnel aboard the 17,000-tonne drilling rig when it became detached from the tug in the early hours of Monday, 8 August.

The survey indicates that only 11% of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit). That compares to 30% of those surveyed in the rest of the UK. The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland. About 250 of those responded to the poll. More than half of the respondents (60%) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote. The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland  also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU. Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that \"the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community\". He said that this was because many made up their minds before knowing the outcome of negotiations, effectively discounting them as irrelevant. \"For businesspeople, this is a question of in or out,\" he said. \"Those within Northern Ireland who are firmly wedded to the EU have said that Brexit will leave us stranded outside the EU, and coping with the re-emergence of a land border with the Republic of Ireland. \"Emotion has a part in all decision making and it will do so here, but there is a duty to ensure decisions are as well informed as they can be.\" Clarification: An earlier version of this article omitted the number of respondents to the Chamber of Commerce survey.",

Mrs Allen then followed the clue and found the golden shell hidden outside Italian restaurant San Pietro. \"I spotted something that looked a lot like discarded litter at the base of a fence across the road from San Pietro,\" said Mrs Allen.

    "source": "He accepted the offer of an alliance from Francois Bayrou, another centrist and devout Roman Catholic. Recent polls suggest support for Mr Macron, tipped by many to win the election, has dropped slightly. Two of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's staff were detained on Wednesday as part of a financial inquiry. Her chief of staff was placed under formal investigation over the alleged misuse of EU funds to pay parliamentary assistants, French media report. Her bodyguard was also questioned. The National Front (FN) leader, who denies any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigation as a \"political dirty trick\". She enjoys a solid lead in opinion polls for the first round in April but is seen as being easily defeated in the second. Mr Bayrou has run three times for president, winning more than 18% of the vote in the 2007 election. Announcing that he would not stand this year, he offered to join forces with Mr Macron to prevent \"the failure of France\". Ms Le Pen, he said, posed a \"major and immediate threat for our country and Europe\". Welcoming the news, Mr Macron, a free-market liberal, told Reuters news agency: \"The alliance proposed by Francois Bayrou... fully matches our commitment to renewal and unity.\" Analysts say Mr Bayrou's support base is likely to split now between Mr Macron and his conservative opponent Francois Fillon. A new opinion poll indicates that Mr Macron and Mr Fillon are neck and neck in the race for the all-important second place in the first round - with both on about 19%. According to the same poll, taken before the alliance was announced, Mr Bayrou would net 5.5% while Ms Le Pen would take 26%. In the second round, Mr Macron would beat Ms Le Pen by 61% to 39%, while Mr Fillon would also defeat the far-right candidate, but by 57% to 43%. Early on in the campaign, Mr Fillon was viewed as the clear favourite to reach the run-off along with Ms Le Pen and win, but a scandal over payments to his family dented his image in January. He had talks with his fellow conservative former prime minister Alain Juppe, whom he beat in the Republican party primaries, on Wednesday, Le Figaro newspaper reports. Ms Le Pen has been accused by the European Parliament of misusing a total of some 340,000 euros (\u00a3289,000; $359,000), AFP news agency reports. It is alleged that she claimed a salary for her bodyguard Thierry Legier for a bogus job and paid her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, as her EU assistant in Brussels when Ms Griset was actually working for the party. Mr Legier and Ms Griset were taken in for questioning on Wednesday. \"The French can tell the difference between genuine scandals and political dirty tricks,\" Ms Le Pen responded, drawing a distinction between her case and that of Mr Fillon. This election promises to one of the most dramatic in decades in France, a core member of the EU with the world's sixth-largest economy. Fillon apologises over family payments. Le Pen refuses to repay 'misused EU cash'",

    "source": "Youngsters are returning to school this week in Scotland, with parents in other areas of the UK preparing children for the next academic year. They are able to buy school shirts for \u00a31 and sweaters for \u00a32. But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said. The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than \u00a35 each. For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for \u00a31, Sainsbury's has put a \u00a32 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for \u00a31.75. Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim. The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries. The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising. Plus-size school uniforms launch. The picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes. Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth \u00a3694m. The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21% since 2004, it said, with supermarkets increasing their market share. However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from \u00a3861m in 2004 to \u00a3694m, the research group said. Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago. \"As long as they last, parents are not too concerned,\" he said. \"Children run around in these things, rip holes in them, and they fall apart anyway. As long as it lasts a term or half a year, parents are quite satisfied with that.\" He added that because wholesale prices of cotton and wool were rising, it would be difficult to cut prices any further. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced it had started to sell over-sized school uniforms for overweight children as young as four. Campaigners said it was simply commercial recognition of the fact obesity was a growing problem among younger pupils. Marks and Spencer said the trial range followed demand from parents.",

    "source": "It was relief more than real jubilation. The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. \"There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. \"I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results.\" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible\", he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away. Israel and the wider Middle East must now wait to see what sort of government will eventually emerge.",

    "source": "Andrew Hutchinson, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, pleaded guilty to rape, sexual assault and voyeurism committed from 2011 to 2013. The 29-year-old filmed himself raping two patients at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he worked. He also attacked women who had passed out while he was on duty at a music festival, Oxford Crown Court heard. Hutchinson targeted women who had lost consciousness through drinking too much and they were unaware they had been assaulted until contacted by Thames Valley Police. The court heard the women he raped in the A&E department at the Oxford hospital had to view parts of Hutchinson's recordings in order to identify themselves. One victim, an 18-year-old, was raped in October 2011 and a 35-year-old was raped in February 2012. He also attacked two women in their 20s while volunteering as a medic at the Wilderness Festival in Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire, in August 2013. His was tending the women when he committed the crimes, one in a medical tent and the other in a nearby ambulance. Officers initially arrested him for secretly filming girls as young as nine in changing rooms at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon in November 2013. Following a search of his home, police found footage of sex attacks on his computer and mobile phone. The court was told Hutchinson also had hundreds of other voyeuristic images, including \"up skirt\" pictures taken on the London Underground while he was  volunteering at the 2012 Olympics. Victims were also filmed at John Radcliffe Hospital and at a gym in Batley, West Yorkshire where he had previously worked. At a hearing on 30 March, he also pleaded guilty to outraging public decency, making indecent images of children, theft of a hospital camera used for internal examinations and possession of the class B drug ketamine. The victims of his crimes were aged between nine and 35, although many were unidentifiable due to the nature of the footage. Catherine Stoddart, chief nurse at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \"I am shocked and horrified by the way in which Andrew Hutchinson has betrayed the patients he was entrusted to care for and his colleagues, who also trusted him.\" She said the hospital will be carrying out an internal review to see if Hutchinson could have been prevented from committing his crimes. Hutchinson was suspended by the trust in November 2013 following allegations he stole medical equipment. It also informed the Nursing and Midwifery Council and launched an internal investigation, which led to his dismissal. Judge Ian Pringle QC described Hutchinson's crimes as \"despicable\". He said: \"When they were unconscious requiring your help and your assistance as their nurse, you raped them and you filmed it. \"It is impossible to conceive of a greater breach of trust in our society.\" In a statement read out in court, one of the victims said: \"I think that what he has done is much worse that doing it in the street because I had no idea what was happening, so I had no opportunity to fight back.\" Senior investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Mark Johns of Thames Valley Police, said: \"This has been a particularly complicated, unusual and sensitive case as the victims were not aware that offences took place because they were not conscious. \"I would like to thank the victims for the great courage and dignity they have shown during our investigation.\" Police said all victims who can be identified have been contacted. Anyone with concerns can contact police on 101, quoting Operation Bream.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year. But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report \"disingenuous\". He said it was \"another example of fudging the facts\". The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union. The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration. It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place. But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration? Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force? Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere? And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK? These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: \"It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.\" Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would \"continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future\", he said. \"Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries,\" he said. \"Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.\" The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work. It said: \"This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000.\" The figures should not be taken as a \"precise estimate\" but were \"intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined\", it said. There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded. Those who are \"self-sufficient\" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK. Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested. However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: \"Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market. \"The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.\" The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe. Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.",

    "source": "The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. \"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said. \"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. \"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

    "source": "His arrest over the death of model Reeva Steenkamp has stunned the country where he is considered a national hero. The 26-year-old is due to appear in court on Friday. Mr Pistorius made history in London last year when he became the first double-amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympic Games. By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg. There is widespread shock and disbelief in South Africa after athlete Oscar Pistorius was arrested over the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. There has been an outpouring of grief for the model, along with many messages of support for the six-time Paralympic champion, who has earned huge public admiration for his long battle to be allowed to compete in the Olympics. The common thread for many is disbelief - at the implication this has for the athlete's future but also at the tragic end of the celebrity couple's love story. The pair apparently started dating in November, frequently posted loving messages about each other on social network Twitter and were seen at high-profile events arm in arm. Their relationship seemed perfect. He is known as the \"blade runner\" because of the carbon fibre prosthetic blades he races in. He was born without a fibula in both legs and had his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday. Police were called to his home in the upmarket Silver Woods gated compound on the outskirts of South Africa's administrative capital in the early hours of Thursday morning. They found paramedics treating a 29-year-old woman with four gunshot wounds to the head and upper body. She died at the scene, and officers recovered a 9mm pistol. Early reports suggested Mr Pistorius might have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. Police say neighbours heard screaming and shouting around the time of the shooting, and that they had been called to investigate incidents of a domestic nature at the same house in the past. They also said that they would oppose any bail application. Hours later, after being questioned by police, Mr Pistorius left a police station accompanied by officers, his face mostly covered by the hood of a grey jacket. His court hearing was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon but had been postponed until Friday to give forensic investigators time to carry out their work, said Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for the prosecution. Mr Pistorius's father, Henke, declined to comment but said: \"We all pray for guidance and strength for Oscar and the lady's parents.'' Miss Steenkamp's publicist confirmed to the BBC that the 29-year-old model had died. \"Everyone who knew her is in tears. She was an absolute angel, the sweetest, sweetest human being, a kind human being,\" Sarit Tomlinson said. In her last Twitter messages, Miss Steenkamp had spoken about her excitement about Valentine's Day. \"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?'' she tweeted. \"It should be a day of love for everyone.'' Mr Pistorius dominated in his category at successive Paralympic Games, but in 2008 he won a legal battle over his blades - which critics said gave him an unfair advantage - with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)  for the right to compete in able-bodied competitions. Oscar Pistorius profile. Reaction: Pistorius shooting. He reached the 400m semi-finals in the London 2012 Olympics. At the Paralympics he won silver in the T44 200m, gold in the 4x100 relay and gold in the T44 400m, setting a Paralympic record. He was named by Time Magazine last year as one of the world's 100 most influential people. In interviews, he had spoken about his enjoyment of target shooting with his pistol, and an online advertisement featuring him for Nike read: \"I am a bullet in the chamber.\" Mr Pistorius's former coach, Andrea Giannini, spoke out in favour of the athlete following his arrest. \"No matter how bad the situation was, Oscar always stayed calm and positive,'' he told the Associated Press news agency. \"Whenever he was tired or nervous he was still extremely nice to people. I never saw him violent.'' South Africa has one of the highest rates of crime in the world and many residents keep weapons to protect themselves against intruders. But gun ownership is strictly regulated and it is not easy to obtain a licence. On Tuesday, a bill seeking to give police extra powers to arrest anyone carrying a dangerous weapon in public was tabled before parliament, following a spate of violent strikes and protests last year.",

    "source": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. \"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. \"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added. \"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. \"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. \"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. \"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. \"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. \"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\". But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",

Her 15-year battle for justice finally bore fruit last week, when the Bombay high court confirmed the life sentences of 11 men found guilty of rape and murder. The court also convicted five policemen and two doctors, who were earlier cleared by the trial court, of destroying evidence. The landmark ruling, Bilkis Bano told the BBC in Delhi on Sunday, had finally given her hope of peace. \"I always had full faith in the judiciary and I'm grateful to the Bombay high court for the order. It's a very good judgement and I'm very happy with it,\" she told me. \"I think the state government and the police were all complicit in the crime, because the accused were given full freedom to rape and pillage,\" she said. \"I feel vindicated that the court has convicted the police and the doctors too. I feel I've received justice.\" Bilkis Bano's fight for justice has been long and nightmarish but, she says, giving up was never an option. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortems. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. Despite the gravity of the crime and the fact she identified her attackers, the first arrests in the case were only made in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators, the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court also accepted her plea that the courts in Gujarat could not deliver her justice and transferred her case to a court in Mumbai. The battle has been hugely disruptive for her family. In the past 15 years, she and her husband Yakub Rasool have moved home 10 times, moving in and out of Gujarat with their five children. \"We still can't go home because we're afraid. Police and the state administration have always helped our attackers. When we are in Gujarat, we still cover our faces, we never give out our address,\" Mr Rasool said. The attack on Bilkis Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began when a fire on a passenger train in Godhra town killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs went on a rampage, attacking Muslim neighbourhoods and destroying their property. For three days the rioters had free rein, as the state administration and the police looked the other way. More than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then Gujarat chief minister, was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied any wrongdoing and has not apologised for the riots. A Supreme Court panel also refused to prosecute him in 2013, citing insufficient evidence. But he's never been able to shake off the criticism completely, with many holding him responsible for the killings on his watch. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for their involvement in the riots. In 2012 an ex-minister and aide to Mr Modi was jailed for 28 years. But many other people are still waiting for justice. Fifteen years later, Bilkis Bano still fights back tears as she recounts the horror of those days. She was visiting her parents, who lived in a village called Randhikpur, not far from Godhra. She was 19 and the mother of a three-year-old daughter, and she was pregnant with her second child. \"It was the morning after the train fire. I was in the kitchen, making lunch, when my aunt and her children came running. They said their homes were being set on fire and we had to leave immediately,\" she said. \"We left with just the clothes we were wearing, we didn't even have the time to put on our slippers.\" Within minutes, all the Muslim homes in the neighbourhood had emptied. The 50-odd families that lived there had gone, looking for safety. Bilkis Bano was in a group of 17 people that included her three-year-old daughter, her mother, a pregnant cousin, her younger siblings, nieces and nephews, and two adult men. \"We first went to the village council head, a Hindu, seeking his protection. But when the mobs began threatening to kill him too if he gave shelter to Muslims, we were forced to leave.\" For the next few days, the group travelled from village to village, seeking shelter in a mosque, or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. But then their time ran out. On the morning of 3 March, as they set out to go to a nearby village where they believed they would be safer, a group of men travelling in two jeeps stopped them. \"They attacked us with swords and sticks. One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock.\" Bilkis Bano had cuts on her hands and legs. Her attackers were her neighbours in the village, 12 men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her. She begged them for mercy and told them she was five months' pregnant, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. Her cousin, who had delivered a baby girl two days earlier while they were on the run, was raped and murdered. Her newborn was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. When she came to, she covered her body with a blood-soaked petticoat, climbed a nearby hill and hid in a cave for a day. \"The next day I was very thirsty so I came down to a nearby tribal village to find some water. The villagers were initially suspicious of me and came out with sticks, but then they helped me. They gave me a blouse and a scarf to cover my body.\" She spotted a police jeep and they took her to the police station, where she narrated her ordeal. \"I'm illiterate so I asked the policemen to read out the complaint once they had written it down, but they refused to do that. They just took my thumb impression and wrote whatever they wanted. I knew all my attackers and I'd named them. But the police did not write down any names,\" she said. The next day, she was sent to a camp in Godhra set up for those displaced by the riots. That's where her husband was reunited with her 15 days later and where they lived for the next few months. Her unborn child survived the rape and she later gave birth to a daughter. The past 15 years have been \"very difficult\", but the couple say the high court order has brought them some closure. In the past few days, comparisons have been drawn between Bilkis Bano's case and that of the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi. A day after the Bilkis Bano judgement, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the four men accused of the crime. Many have since asked whether Bilkis Bano's case did not merit the death penalty for her attackers. Prosecutors had demanded capital punishment for three of the men. Bilkis Bano, however, says she does not believe in revenge. \"Both the crimes were equally horrible, but I don't believe in taking anyone's life. I don't want the death penalty for them,\" she said. \"I want them to spend their entire lives in jail. I hope they will one day realise the enormity of their crime, how they killed small children and raped women. \"I'm not interested in revenge. I just want them to understand what they've done.\"",

The attack happened early on Sunday near the town of Dogubayezit in Agri province, near the border with Iran. Since 24 July, Turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on PKK bases on both sides of the Iraq-Turkey border. A Turkish state news agency, Anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey's army said in a statement that \"long-range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the Karabulak Gendarmerie Station was hit at around 03:00 local time on Sunday (midnight GMT). Images in the Turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The Dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the PKK so far. AFP news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:. Turkey's official news agency says about 260 Kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern Iraq and Turkey since 24 July. It has also targeted positions held by the Islamic State group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further Turkish air strikes on Saturday east of Erbil, said local officials. The pro-PKK Firat news agency described an attack on the village of Zerkel as a \"massacre\". Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani said: \"We condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the Kurdish region, and we call on Turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The Turkish military on Sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in Zerkel, Reuters reported. Turkey considers both the PKK and IS terrorist organisations. The PKK has been fighting Turkey for an autonomous homeland for the Kurds. More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the PKK began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when Turkey launched raids against Kurdish separatist camps in northern Iraq last month. The raids came after the PKK reportedly killed two Turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by Islamic State and what the PKK sees as Turkey's collaboration with IS.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time. \"We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,\" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. \"We're building our own future.\" Around 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves. Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica. And this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers. But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles. The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels. The difference is that it is much cleaner. \"The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. \"No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.\" To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind. \"Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,\" says Mr van Cappellen. Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km. But why develop a bus rather than a car? \"If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,\" says Mr van Cappellen. \"But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.\" Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). More Technology of Business. \"In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent. Its newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why \"it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time\". The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor. \"We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,\" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions. \"The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.\" But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable? \"It costs about 35,000 euros (\u00c2\u00a330,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,\" says Mr van Cappellen. As such, it is \"100 times cheaper\" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains. \"Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,\" he adds. Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon. Some experts believe the technology shows promise. \"Team Fast has a very good project,\" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research. \"It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.\" And several companies are supporting the project. \"What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,\" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry. \"If we achieve this it will give us a stable future.\" The students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week. \"We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,\" Mr van Cappellen says. \"It's our own future we're making.\"",

In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\". He's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\". 4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11. Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim. 5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\". Mr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks. 6. Climate change is just \"weather\" While Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\" 7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power. Mr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists. 8. Illegal migrants should be deported. Trump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation. 9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\" He says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees. 10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\" He has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him. 11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone. Trump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate. 12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\" Mr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class. 13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues. He has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. 14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\" Mr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers. 15. He's worth $10bn. Based on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn. 16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul. Mr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans. 17. Lobbyists should be more restricted. Mr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. 18. He is a \"really nice guy\" In Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post. 19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman. A video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\" 20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals. He has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\". 21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\" Why? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance. 22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions. Or should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead. 23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\" He called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him. 24. The federal minimum wage should be raised. Workers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.

Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) and Sussex Police are searching one residential address. The arrest is not linked to any immediate threat in the UK, police said. Crawley MP Henry Smith said police told him early this morning that a 40-year-old man had been arrested at a property thought to be in the Langley Green area of the town. He said: \"I understand he has been arrested in relation to membership of organisations which are connected with activity to the Syrian civil war.\" Mr Smith said he understood people would be concerned over news of the arrest, particularly following the death of Abdul Waheed Majeed, from Crawley, who died in a suspected suicide attack in Syria in February last year. The 41-year-old, who was born and raised in Crawley, drove a truck bomb into the gates of a prison in Aleppo. The father of three had left Britain in 2013 telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Mr Smith said: \"These cases are in the minority but they are very concerning and the public need to feel that they are as protected as they can be.\" A spokesperson for SECTU said the unit was committed to intervening in activities \"which cause concern to local communities\". \"We will continue to work with our partners and local communities in order to protect them from individuals and organisations which may seek to exploit them for extremist purposes,\" the spokesperson added.

    "source": "The latest data sent back from the probe has made Nasa scientists believe that Saturn's ice-crusted moon Enceladus may now be the single best place to go to find life beyond our Earth. So, before we get all Doctor Who, let's take a look at some top facts about the exciting moon for ET-spotters... Enceladus is the sixth largest moon of Saturn. It is about 500 kilometres (310 miles) in diameter, making it pretty small. In comparison, the Earth is over 12,000 kilometres in diameter. Saturn has many different types of moons, some are very small, and one - Titan - is very, very large! Altogether, Saturn has 62 confirmed moons, 53 of which have names, and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometres. Enceladus is named after a giant from Greek mythology. The name was decided by the son of the man who first discovered it, astronomer Frederick William Herschel. He spotted Enceladus all the way back in 1789, during the first use of his new telescope, which was the largest in the world at the time. Enceladus is covered in a thick surface of ice. But it's what lies deep below this icy surface that has got scientists really excited! It's thought a warm ocean flows below the surface, where the conditions to support life could exist. Jets of water vapour and ice particles erupt from Enceladus' underground ocean through deep icy crevasses called tiger stripes near the moon's south pole. These plumes have provided clues about the planets inner-workings. The Cassini spacecraft conducted a fly-through of the plumes, helping to provide the data that has led scientists to believe the planet could hold life.",

The app allows users to send a message saying \"yo\" to friends - and nothing else. It has been branded \"pointless\", but has nonetheless raised $1m (\u00a3600,000) in investment. TechCrunch said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app. \"We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back),\" the students told TechCrunch. \"We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user...

Similar problems have hit apps such as Snapchat and Tinder in the past few months. Mr Arbel told TechCrunch he was dealing with the issue, but would not elaborate further. \"Some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on,\" he said, adding that he had hired a specialist security team. \"We are taking this very seriously.\" Despite the app's apparent pointlessness, it has quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of users.

    "source": "Such values are ill-defined and vulnerable to misinterpretation, argued Southend head teacher, Robin Bevan. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) voted to monitor the policing of the requirement, introduced in England by the government last year. Mr Bevan said he had concerns about how the values \"might be interpreted by a future right-wing government\". \"When it comes to the new requirement of promoting fundamental British values, including the role of law, here is one law that I would actively encourage you to disengage from\", Mr Bevan, head of Southend High School for Boys, urged the union's annual conference in Liverpool. The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham. Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school \"no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved\". Requiring schools to promote \"fundamental British values\" could have \"unintended consequences\", according to the text of the motion debated by the conference in Liverpool. \"There is no one in this hall who would argue against the important role that schools and colleges play in promoting personal morality, in developing a sense of civic duty, in fostering engagement with our democratic structures or in embracing a wider global understanding,\" said Mr Bevan. He said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing this within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding. \"These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective.\" He accused the rules on British values as \"deeply ill-considered\" and \"political posturing\". \"In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?\" They change over time, with women now \"allowed\" the vote, said Mr Bevan. \"If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe them as fundamental.\" But, he argued, the problem was not just one of definition. \"Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right-wing government, or a partner in that government.\" He said he was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values. There had already been cases of \"less-skilled inspectors\" doing this in a \"wholly-inappropriate way\", he told journalists later. In particular he was concerned about the difference between \"what is taught and what is learned\", with a proportion of every class apt to misunderstand or ignore lessons, be they about trigonometry or British values. \"I am not sure the government should ever be in the business of dictating values that should be taught in schools - but students should engage in those debates... plurality, that's the way it should be,\" said Mr Bevan.",

They said she put the bodies in plastic bags and packed them in boxes in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, about 45 miles (75km) south of Salt Lake City. She left the boxes behind when she moved out of the house and they were found by her estranged husband, Darren West, last April. A seventh baby also found there was believed to be stillborn. Police said Huntsman had been a heavy methamphetamine user and \"didn't want the babies\". In court papers she said she wanted to take responsibility for the deaths. Officials said Mr West was the father of the babies but he was not a suspect in the case. He and Huntsman have three other children together. In April 2014 he had just been released after serving eight years in prison for drug crimes and was retrieving some of his belongings from the house when he made the gruesome discovery. A final decision on how long Huntsman will spend behind bars will be made by a parole board. Prosecutors said that she was likely to spend the rest of her life in prison.",

Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Manchester coroner Simon Nelson concluded that something in the sorbet had triggered a fatal reaction.

Rochdale Coroner's Court heard Mrs Thompson, a 50-year-old mother of two, knew eating eggs, milk or apples would make her seriously ill. When she went on holiday to Rhodes in 2012 with her family, she told the hotel's management about her concerns. Her husband Ian told the hearing that shortly after eating the dessert his wife complained of a tingling sensation in her mouth and feared she was having a severe allergic reaction. He said she went to the hotel room and collapsed. She never regained consciousness. The inquest heard a Greek pathologist later concluded she died of natural causes, probably due to heart failure. Mr Thompson said he always believed his wife died as a result of anaphylactic shock. A British pathologist later confirmed that was indeed the cause of her death, the hearing was told. Mr Nelson said he found it \"astonishing\" that neither the hotel management nor holiday company had launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mrs Thompson's death. Thomson said in a statement: \"We note the verdict of the inquest today and we'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family at this extremely difficult time.\"",

He acknowledged this would impact on civilian and military staff but provisions were being made, he said. The sites include an RAF base, barracks, ex-World War Two airfields and a chaplaincy centre. They also include two golf courses at RAF Henlow and Southwick Park in Hampshire. Meanwhile, Network Rail has announced it will release land at almost 200 sites for 12,000 new homes by 2020. This includes 5,000 homes in London, 3,600 homes in Manchester and the north, 1,700 homes in the Midlands and the east of England and 1,400 homes in the south of England. The 13 military sites that will be sold by the MoD are:. The MoD said the land at Venning and Parsons Barracks are the only sites that will not have housing built on them, as they will be used for commercial development at the request of Telford and Wrekin Council. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"We are getting rid of land that we don't need to build homes that we do, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in the process. \"Our commitment to protect and increase the budget for our armed forces means that every penny of that will be reinvested into defence, helping to keep Britain safe.\" But shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis said: \"Affordable housing is desperately needed across the UK, particularly by service families, who have seen the cost of their housing go up as conditions get worse. \"So it's disappointing that the MoD has failed to say how many of these potential new homes will be affordable, or how many could be set aside for service personnel. \"In fact, they cannot even reassure us that these sites will be used to build new homes at all,\" he said. \"What we're looking at is the double impact of 18,000 MoD staff losing their jobs and public land potentially being sold on the cheap for developers to profit from,\" a Public and Commercial Services union spokesman said. \"The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure any land sold not only realises its full value, but that house-builders are forced to ensure enough affordable homes are provided.\" In a written statement, Mr Lancaster said consultations will take place over the coming weeks with \"stakeholders\" including trade unions, to determine the future of each site and their occupants. \"The release of land by the MoD has the potential to provide land for new homes and we will continue to engage with impacted local authorities to determine how the department's assessment of housing unit allocation against each site may be considered as part of the authority's Local Plan,\" he said. \"I acknowledge that these moves will have an impact upon civilian and military staff; the department is making arrangements to provide for units and functions based at sites which will not have a future defence requirement.\" An MoD spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm how exactly it would affect staff at the sites, but she said \"the majority\" will be provided for and moved to accommodation elsewhere, for example. Mr Lancaster said the sales would contribute \u00a3225m towards the MoD's \u00a31bn target for land release sales, as set out in its spending review last year. The release of the sites contributes to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes by 2020, he said.

    "source": "Currently Britain does not have a national bird, but ornithologist David Lindo believes that should change. A shortlist of 10 birds has been chosen by online voters on his campaign's website from an original list of 60. Mr Lindo will close the vote on the day of the general election, 7 May, and ask the new government to officially appoint the winner as national bird. The RSPB welcomed the initiative and said the lack of a national bird for Britain was a \"glaring omission\". Mr Lindo, the self-styled \"Urban Birder\", told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation.\" He hoped the appointment could be \"the first act\" of a new government, once the dust has settled from \"the other election\", he told the programme. The robin has emerged as an early favourite, but Mr Lindo, who is backing the blackbird, told Today: \"People consider the robin as a British bird - but [like] a lot of our native birds... some of the population move south to Iberia for the winter and are replaced by immigrants from the continent. \"So the robin you see in your back garden during winter is not necessarily British born.\" And he added: \"It is quite a violent bird.\" A first round of polling on the campaign's website received 70,000 votes. One of England's rarest birds, the hen harrier, is something of a surprise contender, according to Mr Lindo. \"I was expecting 10 garden birds in the list,\" he said, adding that the original pool of 60 candidates included favourites from literature and song such as the turtledove, nightingale and skylark - all of which have dropped out of contention. The hen harrier, which was the subject of a recent campaign because it had been the target of illegal hunting, was down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago  and \"may already be extinct\", he said. The robin is sometimes mistakenly thought of as the nation's official bird, the RSPB said, after it was given the title unofficially by some enthusiasts in the 1960s. Northern Ireland does not have an official national bird, while the golden eagle and red kite are sometimes regarded as unofficial national symbols of Scotland and Wales respectively. In December 2013 a petition was lodged by the RSPB for the golden eagle to be recognised as Scotland's official national symbol, but the Scottish parliament voted against the plans after it decided the RSPB needed to do more to show greater support for the proposals. The RSPB said it welcomed Mr Lindo's initiative in getting people to discuss their favourite birds. And it said the fact Britain did not already have an official national bird while other countries did was a \"glaring omission\". Grahame Madge, spokesman for the RSPB, said: \"It's opened people's eyes to birds, which is raising awareness. As an organisation we are really behind him. \"It seems most other nations have pipped us to the post in identifying a national bird, and for the UK not to have a national bird when we are a nation of bird lovers does seem to be a glaring omission.\" The shortlist, in pictures:. 1. Mute swan. 2. Red kite. 3. Hen harrier. 4. Puffin. 5. Barn owl. 6. Kingfisher. 7. Wren. 8. Robin. 9. Blackbird. 10. Blue tit.",

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles dropped to four with $14.8m (\u00a310.4m). Following a spate of poor performing sequels such as The Huntsman: Winter's War, Alice Through the Looking Glass and Ride Along 2, The Conjuring 2 opened nearly on par with its 2013 original. \"There's seemingly been a spell cast over the second instalments and The Conjuring, I think, broke that spell,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \"Just the overall quality won over the audience in a genre that's generally looked down upon from a critical perspective.'' Big budget CGI extravaganza Warcraft, taken from the hit video game franchise, reportedly cost $160m (\u00a3112.8m) to make, so effectively bombed in the US financially as well as critically. However, it was a phenomenal success overseas, particularly in China where it made $156m (\u00a3110m) in its first five days, surpassing 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron to set a new record for the biggest debut for a foreign release. The game is particularly popular there, even spawning a theme park. The magician crime caper Now You See Me 2, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo and Woody Harrelson, followed the disappointing trajectory of most recent sequels, dropping from its 2013 original opening debut of $29.4m (\u00a320.8) to $23m (\u00a316.2m). The fifth Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, Out of the Shadows, fell to number four in only its second weekend. The last movie in the franchise grossed nearly double in its opening weekend box office. Rounding off the top five was X-Men: Apocalypse, taking $10m (\u00a37m) in a troubling third weekend.

The pilots' strike, called over a pay dispute, will affect around 100,000 passengers, Lufthansa said. The industrial action is part of a long-running pay dispute at Lufthansa. The pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has organised 14 strikes since April 2014. Short and medium-haul flights from Germany will be affected from 00:01 to 23:59 local time (23:01-22:59 GMT). Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines including Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Air Dolomiti and Brussels Airlines are not affected by the strike, the airline said. Pay talks between the Vereinigung union and the German airline broke down earlier this month, and Lufthansa said the union had \"consistently rejected the offer\" of mediation. The union is calling for a 3.7% pay rise for 5,400 pilots dating back to 2012. Lufthansa, which is facing increasing competition from budget rivals, offered a 2.5% increase over the six years until 2019. Meanwhile, a separate dispute with cabin crew at Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary, Eurowings, led it to cancel more than 60 flights on Tuesday.",

The comments angered Mr Bayoh's family, as the Police Investigations Review Commissioner investigation into his death continues. Mr Matheson told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: \"There is a robust investigation being taken forward through the Police Investigation and Review Commissioner and that is also being directed by the Crown Office. \"As the Lord Advocate has made clear this week, it is better if all parties refrain from making comment while the investigation is taking place. \"I don't think it is helpful if people are giving a running commentary on issues around this investigation while it is being undertaken.\"",

    "source": "While ministers claim their Psychoactive Substances Bill reflects the findings of the experts, I am told that the hand-picked committee was divided on whether low-harm substances like amyl nitrate (poppers) and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) should be included. The final report was drafted by Home Office officials but some members of the panel, which included three people who also sit on the ACMD, insisted on writing in what became known as the \"safety-valve\" clause. The recommendation for \"general prohibition\" was amended to say that there should be exemptions for substances \"where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\".  The line was included specifically to ensure that some low risk products could be excluded from the ban. The coalition government response last October went along with the safety-valve clause saying it would \"explore how to put in place a schedule of exemptions and make provision to add to these where the risks of health and social harms can be adequately assessed\". But when the new Conservative government published the Psychoactive Substances Bill last month, any mention of assessing social harms or health risks had gone.  The safety-valve clause insisted upon by the expert panel had been removed. The Home Office has made it clear that \"there is no provision in the Bill to enable the licensing of so-called low-harm substances\" arguing that there are difficulties in defining low risk and that it might \"send out confusing messages about the safety of new psychoactive substances\". It is likely that this is going to be a major battleground as the controversial bill reaches committee stage in Parliament. The LibDem Home Affairs spokesman Lord Paddick has made it clear his party will oppose the legislation in its current form. \"As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm,\" he told the House of Lords. The Bill would ban any substance that affects a consumer's \"mental functioning or emotional state\", unless specifically exempted by the Home Secretary.  This definition goes further than the Irish legislation on which the approach is modelled. In Ireland, a psychoactive substance is defined as one that results in \"a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood\". The word \"significant\" is, of course, significant. It provides the safety valve that excludes low-risk and low-harm products. Whether UK ministers will relent on this issue of a \"safety-valve clause\" is perhaps the biggest question as the Psychoactive Substances Bill makes its progress through Parliament.",

    "source": "Councils in England are facing a \u00a31.1bn shortfall this year, on top of \"almost unendurable\" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\". She said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\". Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\" \"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo  will pay tribute to the Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday this year. It will include a cast of more than 1,200 performers and over 250 pipers and drummers from around the world. Twenty-five performances will take place across August, with a combined live audience of 220,000 people. The Royal Air Force will open the show with a flypast on selected evenings, including a planned flypast by the world-famous Red Arrows on Saturday at 19.30. It will commemorate the centenary of the Great Arab Revolt - the British-backed uprising against the German-allied Ottoman Turks depicted in the film Lawrence Of Arabia. The anniversary of The Battle of Jutland will also be marked during the event. Brigadier David Allfrey, The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo's chief executive and producer, said: \"We are particularly proud to add our celebration to Her Majesty the Queen's special year while marking other important anniversaries: Jutland and the Great Arab Revolt. \"Above all though, the music is the star.

It is a free event called Deep Time, which will see artwork projected onto the western fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of Edinburgh Castle and Castle Rock. The digitally-animated projections will be inspired by the city's past, set to a special soundtrack by Scottish rock band Mogwai. It will chart 350 million years of Edinburgh's history, looking at how volcanic activity formed the landscape and exploring the intellectual legacy of the city. In particular, it will celebrate the work of renowned Edinburgh scientist and thinker James Hutton. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe also gets under way.

    "source": "The materials, which can sense pressure as sensitively and quickly as human skin,  have been outlined by two groups reporting in Nature Materials. The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The arrays are built into or under flexible rubber sheets that could be stretched into a variety of shapes. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance. \"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers. \"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News. \"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials. \"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote. However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.",

It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a fast food restaurant in the early hours of Tuesday. Police attended and said a man was taken away by officers but no arrests were made. The WRU said while the player, aged 28, was on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training it operated a strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: \"The player has been suspended due to a clear breach of the standards which we expect to be maintained by someone involved in one of our national squads. \"Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards. \"Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence ... that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. \"It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. \"That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. \"Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image.\" The incident occurred outside a McDonald's restaurant in Queen Street. Footage taken by bystanders shows Phillips being restrained by police before being led away in handcuffs to a police van. South Wales Police say he was not arrested. The player was recently released by the Ospreys regional rugby team after securing a move to French club Bayonne. The WRU said the suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. Wales team manager Alan Phillips said: \"We have suspended Mike Phillips on the clear evidence of a level of behaviour we regard as unacceptable. \"It is clear there has been a breach of our disciplinary standards.\" Cardiff Blues scrum-half Lloyd Williams has been called into the Wales Rugby World Cup training squad as a replacement and will report for duty on Monday.",

    "source": "Warning: Readers may find some of the details of violence in this piece distressing. It was late October 2014, and on paper the young banker had lived what could only be described as a privileged and successful life. But over the space of a few drug- and alcohol-fuelled days, he tortured and killed Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, before calling the police to let them know what he had done. In court, lawyers described a much darker side to his apparently gilded existence, one involving drugs, sexual sadism, and an extreme personality disorder. Jutting had tortured Ms Ningsih for three days, before he killed her by slashing her throat over a prolonged period, nearly decapitating her. He then hid her body in a suitcase. A few days later, Jutting brought his second victim, Ms Mujiasih, to his flat. This was a woman he would go on to describe simply as \"the prey\" he had been hunting. \"Sumarti was generous. That much is clear from the evidence in the house. Her driving force was to improve life for her family, to make them richer. Life may be peaceful in the village but she would have been all too aware of the possibilities of a life with more material comforts.\" The story of Sumarti: Born in Indonesia, murdered in Hong Kong. Experts for the defence say Jutting's IQ score is 137 - putting him in the top 1% of the population. But they also diagnosed him with four disorders, which they said combined to lead to the killings:. \u2022Narcissistic personality disorder. \u2022Sexual sadism disorder. \u2022Cocaine use disorder. \u2022Alcohol use disorder. Prosecution witnesses argued that such conditions should not \"substantially\" diminish his ability to control his actions. But according to the defence, when it came to his narcissism, the signs were there from an early age. Jutting was born in London in 1985. His first name Rurik was chosen by his mother, and literally translated as \"great one\" - it was an imperial dynasty in Russia. He described himself as an ambitious boy who had a happy childhood. But even from a young age, Jutting displayed feelings of superiority and entitlement, his defence argued. He was admitted to the prestigious private school Winchester College in his early teens but was disappointed that he ranked sixth in the scholarship selection, rather than first. When his mother expressed delight at his entrance exam results, Jutting commented that he found her reaction \"almost insulting\", because it implied that she was surprised he had got in. There were other troubling episodes. When he was 16, his father tried to take his own life by slashing his wrists while he was in the house. Jutting had to help provide the initial care and go to hospital with him. Jutting also said he had been sexually assaulted by another student while studying at Winchester. In 2003, he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said he experienced suicidal thoughts and that he was affected by knowledge of his parents' marital problems and concerns about his mother's health. Nonetheless, Jutting excelled academically, being admitted to Cambridge University to study history and law at Peterhouse college. A fellow of the college, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC Mr Jutting was ambitious, a keen athlete, committed to his studies and from a stable Catholic background. British banker guilty of murders. Killed by Jutting and forgotten by Indonesia. 'We were lucky it wasn't us' (video) Jutting gained first class honours in his history degree but was disappointed to receive a 2:1 in law, and challenged the examiner's approach. The inability to accept criticism, psychiatrists said, was another sign of his narcissistic personality traits. On graduation, Jutting worked at Barclays bank, before being head-hunted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His role involved developing complex tax products and, within a few years, his salary had risen to \u00a3270,000 ($334,705) per year. But then, things began to go wrong. In 2012, while trying to market a tax product in Luxembourg, auditors began investigating his team for possible violation of regulations, flagging up Jutting in particular as a serious risk to the organisation.  Jutting described this as a \"negative turning point\" in his career and felt his move to Hong Kong the subsequent year had been arranged by bosses to get him out of the way. At one point, his manager told Jutting he was one of the most unpredictable people he had ever worked with. Jutting's alcohol use was also uncontrollable around this time, as he needed to drink excessive amounts in order to get to sleep. His then-girlfriend was so worried about his reliance on alcohol she banned him from drinking at home. He briefly saw a psychiatrist at this point, and said he often felt down and tearful at work. By the time he had moved to Hong Kong in October 2013, he was consuming three quarters of a bottle of vodka to sleep and using cocaine. He said he smuggled cocaine up his rectum on his flight to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, he rented a flat in The J Residence, a luxury development in Wanchai popular with expatriate workers. Although located in a busy street in the heart of the city, the development gives off a sense of exclusivity.  Keycards are needed to access individual floors, while the sheer height of the building, at over 41 floors, means that residents can enjoy views of Hong Kong's skyline - from the bar, garden, and even swimming pool on the roof. But Jutting described himself as feeling increasingly despondent and nihilistic in the city. He did not have much of a social life  and spent long periods drinking at home while playing computer games. Jutting also had extreme sexual interests, and an obsession with sadistic pornography, experts said. He began using sex workers in 2009 and as time went on his behaviour became increasingly forceful. On a number of occasions, he removed condoms during sex without their consent, despite knowing this would constitute rape in the UK. Jutting continued to fantasise about rape and kidnap even while he was remanded in a psychiatric centre after his arrest, prosecution expert Dr Kavin Chow said. By 2014, he was \"spiralling out of control\". He would go on cocaine binges that lasted for days. At one point, he missed a scheduled meeting in London and, as an excuse, he told his boss he had HIV. He developed a round-the-clock craving for the drug, his weight ballooned and in the weeks before the killings took place he stopped going to work. Instead, he spent hours watching and reading violent pornography. He attempted to find men on Grindr to have sex with, later telling a psychologist he had been \"trying to do everything I could to get new experiences\", but described everything as \"disappointing\". On 25 October 2014 Jutting took Ms Ningsih to his flat, after offering to pay her for sex. They had had sex on one occasion before, in a hotel, but things had got so violent that Ms Ningsih asked to end the session early, and refunded half his money. On this second occasion, the sex also switched from consensual to non-consensual, as Jutting began to beat Ms Ningsih. He then held her captive, and tortured her using pliers, his belt, sex toys and his hands. He filmed some of the torture on his phone, in footage that was shown to the jury. The details that follow are distressing and brutal. Jutting claims he drifted in and out of the influence of cocaine: \"When I became relatively less under the influence of cocaine I became quite apologetic - I told her repeatedly I loved her,\" he said in one police interview. Yet, in another interview, he said that he hadn't tortured Ms Ningsih as much as he would have liked, before killing her. He killed her on the third day, after he made her kneel in front of the toilet bowl, with her hands tied behind her back, and lick the bowl. He then cut her throat with a knife but Ms Ningsih did not die immediately, so her dragged her into the shower and continued. Jutting recorded several videos describing the aftermath of the killing on his phone.  Eventually, he wrapped up the body and placed it into a suitcase, which he left on the balcony. Jutting began planning to torture a second victim on 31 October.  He bought tools, including sandpaper, nails and a blow torch, filming them on his iPhone, describing how he might use them to torture a victim. That night, he went out and met Ms Mujiasih, inviting her back to his flat for sex. They began kissing and cuddling on the sofa but Ms Mujiasih began shouting when she saw a gag by the sofa. Jutting held a knife against her throat, telling her he would kill her if she continued to struggle. She continued struggling, and he killed her by slashing at her neck. He later told police: \"She was simply, the word I'd use is prey. I was hunting for prey and she was unfortunately the person who was hunted\". After taking more cocaine, he says he contemplated taking his own life. He eventually called 999. He also called his boss, saying: \"I'm in a lot of trouble, you need to do something about the reputation of the bank.\" Even though he had not been to work in the two weeks leading up to the killings, the office was still on his mind. After he killed Ms Ningsih, he changed the out-of-office message from his work email to: \"I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [Last line only really worked if I had followed through..]\" On one occasion, according to an expert witness, Jutting likened his life to The Truman Show, a movie starring Jim Carrey about a man who's entire life, unbeknownst to him, is a TV show. This too may reflect his narcissism because Jutting wanted to believe that \"his life was so significant that\u2026 millions of people would be interested in watching it\". He is now likely to spend much if not all of it in jail.",

The CIA said there was \"no indication\" that anything classified was released. But the documents do include a draft security clearance application containing personal information. They appear to all date to 2009, when Mr Brennan was seeking security clearance while applying for a job as a White House counterterrorism adviser. He was working in the private sector at the time, having already spent 25 years working for the CIA between 1980 and 2005. A high-school student claimed he was responsible for hacking the AOL account, telling Nthe New York Post he was protesting against US foreign policy. The boy's Twitter account, which says he is 13, has published redacted images of what appears to be government information. The documents published by Wikileaks include a draft on national security challenges said to have been created in 2007. The final, unfinished paragraph is headed \"Damaging Leaks of Classified Information\". A 2008 letter about interrogation methods is also included, appearing to be from the vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to his fellow board members. Wikileaks said it would release more documents \"over the coming days\". The FBI and the Secret Service are investigating the hacking. The CIA stressed that none of the documents released so far were classified. \"In fact, they appear to be documents that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess,\" a statement said.

The use of private email has become a major issue in recent months for White House hopeful Hillary Clinton, since it emerged that she had operated a private account while secretary of state.

Belfast Magistrates' Court was told she would not be able to leave without the hospital's permission. The woman cannot be named amid claims that identifying her would increase the risk of her taking her own life. A press challenge to the temporary reporting restrictions is due to be heard next month. The woman was arrested by detectives investigating the child's death following an incident in Belfast in March. She was charged with murder and then held under the Mental Health Act. Her barrister revealed on Wednesday that a medical report had now been prepared. Based on its contents he sought a termination of the current arrangements for keeping his client at the facility. \"The application is that she be remanded on bail, subject to the condition that she continues to reside (there),\" he said. A doctor who assessed the accused confirmed that the health trust consented to the proposal, provided the accused was there as a detained person. The judge was informed that under those arrangements the woman would not be able to leave. Granting the application, she listed the criminal proceedings for a further update in eight weeks time.",

The judges said the book \"takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both interesting and visceral\". \"It challenges every citizen of this country to examine exactly what we're asking soldiers to do in Afghanistan,\" the panel continued. \"Rather than offering easy answers it lets the soldiers speak for themselves.\" Other awards presented included a posthumous honour for Christopher Hitchens, whose final book, Arguably, was included on the long list for the top prize. Hitchens' widow Carol Blue accepted the award on behalf of the Vanity Fair writer. The journalism prize was awarded to Amelia Gentleman for her work in The Guardian, while the blog award went to Rangers Tax Case - an online commentary on the ongoing financial problems at the historic Scottish football club. The writers of the blog said they aimed to \"provide the details of what Rangers FC have done, why it was illegal and what the implications are for one of the largest football clubs in Britain\". The winners were chosen from shortlists of six books, six journalists and seven bloggers, whittled down from longlists of 17 books, 12 journalists and 18 bloggers.

The move, if enacted, would make them the first UK banks to introduce negative interest rates, in effect, charging to deposit money. \"Global interest rates remain at very low levels... this could result in us charging interest on credit balances,\" it wrote in a letter to customers. Personal customers are not affected. However, charities and community groups are counted as business clients and so would be affected by the changes, the banks said. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns NatWest, told the BBC the letter was sent to just under 1.3 million of the combined business and commercial customers of the two banks. \"We will consider any necessary action in the event of the Bank of England base rate falling below zero, but will do our utmost to protect our customers from any impacts,\" they said. Jack: The weird world of negative interest rates. The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 170,000 members, called on other banks to update customers of any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) \"during this uncertain economic period\". Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said the warning from Natwest and RBS \"will be deeply concerning to small firms\". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were \"giving themselves wiggle room in the very unlikely event\" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative. \"The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact they put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences,\" he told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut them to a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept them on hold earlier this month, despite speculation it would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely \"some monetary policy easing\" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, he has said he does not favour rates falling any lower than 0.25%. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing it to use their money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding their money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.",

He said the move was \"apparently\" in response to him saying the party's current leadership \"couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding\". But a spokesman said his membership had lapsed earlier this year. And party leader Paul Nuttall said the businessman - who has suggested he should be made party chairman to shake up the party's policymaking and campaigning - was causing \"negative and damaging publicity\". In a letter to Mr Banks, Mr Nuttall said the party's ruling NEC had agreed to meet the businessman later this month to discuss his ideas but this invitation could be withdrawn if he continued to criticise UKIP and its leadership. He added: \"I should make clear that, whilst I am open to working with you on improving and enhancing our party, the party chairmanship is not on offer.\" Mr Banks, who gave \u00c2\u00a31m to the party ahead of the 2015 general election, has been sceptical about the leadership of Paul Nuttall and has recently spoken of founding a new political movement to \"drain the swamp\" of Westminster politics. He also suggested he could stand against Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, by using a recall petition to trigger a by-election in his Clacton constituency. But Mr Carswell played down the importance of Mr Banks' announcement, telling the BBC: \"It's always very sad when one of UKIP's 40,000 members leaves the party for whatever reason.\" Referencing previous claims that he had prevented former UKIP leader Nigel Farage from being knighted, Mr Carswell added: \"I have no more say in NEC decisions at UKIP than I do in who gets a knighthood.\" On Mr Banks' suggestion that he could stand against Mr Carswell in Clacton at the next general election, the MP said: \"Each time I've stood there've been some wonderfully colourful characters on the ballot paper. \"I even had a chap who changed his name by deed poll to Lord Ha Ha Woof Woof. I'm sure at the next election there'll be some colourful characters too - the more the merrier.\" Apology to squash clubs. But in a statement, Mr Banks claimed UKIP had \"somehow managed to allow my membership to lapse this year despite having given considerably more than the annual membership fee over the past 12 months\". \"On reapplying I was told my membership was suspended pending my appearance at a NEC meeting,\" he said. \"Apparently, my comments about the party being run like a squash club committee and Mr Carswell have not gone down well. \"I now realise I was being unfair to squash clubs all over the UK and I apologise to them. We will now be concentrating on our new movement.\" However, a UKIP spokesman said Mr Banks was notified last year that his membership was due for renewal at the start of October but he \"chose not to renew despite reminders\". \"With this his membership expired on 1st January 2017,\" the spokesman said. \"It would not be possible to suspend Mr Banks from something of which he is not a member.\"",

    "source": "Real politics will inevitably mean concession and compromise after a campaign in which both sides seemed at times to suggest it was a choice between Utopia and Armageddon. Politicians on the Leave side have already candidly admitted that some of their supporters will be 'disappointed' by the deal that emerges.

Equally, on the Remain side there is palpable dismay bordering on despair, but politicians must work hard to ensure that frustration and disillusionment can be quickly soothed. Britain has a tough job on and it will be far harder in a climate of bitterness and division. The campaign itself was unedifying to many. The standing of politicians was frighteningly low before the referendum and one suspects their stock will not have been raised by the events of the last few months. The institutions and public servants whose expertise and motives were called into question at times during the campaign are going to be key to guiding Britain through the turbulent times ahead. The British people must have confidence in their system of governance and their precious democracy at this uncertain time. We have proved to be remarkably resilient in the past. We will need the same grit, determination and courage now. Emotions are running high on both sides of the argument and there will be a need for a calm head at the steering wheel as Britain navigates the \"bumps in the road\". Offering comfort to foreign-born residents that they will be treated fairly and protected from abuse is essential. The same goes for British ethnic minorities. After all the accusations of lying during the campaign, the public must believe now they are being given honest counsel. The process just beginning will not yield speedy benefits. Some will suggest that the very people who are charged with guiding Britain out of the EU are trying to undermine it. There will be anger and bitterness. It will need to be managed carefully.",

    "source": "NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says he worries they will put vulnerable people \"at risk\", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says they will \"inevitably lead to patients suffering\" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims they will be put in \"harm's way\". It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked.  And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days \"would always wonder\" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be \"irreparably damaged\", he warned. This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments.

Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to \"all the victims of the conflict\", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\" to end the conflict. \"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency. Mr Santos said on Twitter: \"This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace.\" The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: \"What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: \"I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible.\" Earlier, he had written: \"The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\" This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as \"encouragement\" to the rebels. \"Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. \"The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party. 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

Nationalist MP Angus Robertson said: \"There is serious cause for concern with a range of appointments - we are witnessing the creation of one of the most right-wing Cabinets in the modern era. \"From Boris Johnson as our Foreign Secretary - a man who will now be representing us on the world stage - to David Davis as Brexit Minister and Liam Fox for Trade, it will be Brexiteers who are taking forward UK foreign policy.\" He added that although Mrs May spoke about social justice her \"mask had already slipped\" and the \"reality is we are witnessing a sharp turn to the right in UK politics.\" Scotland's only Labour MP Ian Murray said: \"Despite Theresa May's rhetoric on the steps of Number 10 last night, this new Tory cabinet looks even more right wing than the one that we've just left behind. \"People across Scotland will not be fooled by new management at the top of the Tory Government. \"Their economic credibility lies in tatters after taking a gamble with Brexit and they have put the union at risk, not just as a result of this referendum.\"",

    "source": "German side Borussia Monchengladbach will be the other team in Group C. Premier League champions Leicester will play Porto, Club Brugge and FC Copenhagen in their debut campaign. Arsenal have been drawn alongside Paris St-Germain, Basel and Ludogorets, with Tottenham facing Monaco, CSKA Moscow and Bayer Leverkusen. Spanish side Real Madrid beat neighbours Atletico on penalties in last season's final, becoming European champions for a record 11th time. Zinedine Zidane's side meet German outfit Borussia Dortmund, Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Legia Warsaw of Poland. Guardiola, who replaced Manuel Pellegrini at the end of last season, is Barcelona's most successful boss, leading the Spanish club to 14 major trophies between 2008 and 2012. He helped the Catalans, who are five-time European champions, win the Champions League in 2009 and 2011. After leaving the Nou Camp, the former Spain midfielder took charge of German side Bayern Munich and lost to his former side in the 2014-15 Champions League semi-finals. City, who lost to champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals last season, qualified for the group stage thanks to a 6-0 aggregate win over Romania's Steaua Bucharest. As well as facing Barcelona for a third time in four seasons, City also return to Monchengladbach, whom they beat home and away in last season's group stage. \"It is not a nightmare draw because we are in a wonderful competition - but it is a very tough group,\" City director of football Txiki Begiristain said. \"Pep knows the group very well - obviously Barcelona but also Borussia Monchengladbach from his time in Germany.\" Leicester produced one of the great sporting shocks to win last season's Premier League title and qualify for the Champions League for the first time. The Foxes' last involvement in European football saw them knocked out of the Uefa Cup in the first round by Red Star Belgrade in 2000. Claudio Ranieri's side could have been drawn in a group with last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and Turkish league winners Besiktas. Although they face Portuguese champions Porto, who have reached the group stage for a sixth successive season, Belgian title winners Club Brugge and Danish champions FC Copenhagen have shown little Champions League pedigree in recent years. Brugge are competing in the group stage for the first time since 2005-06, while Copenhagen are 81st in Uefa's club rankings. \"With the history of all the clubs we could have been drawn against, it was always going to be an interesting draw,\" said Foxes director of football Jon Rudkin. \"These are three very established European football clubs and strong teams.\" Russian side Rostov - the only other Champions League debutants this season - face Atletico and German champions Bayern Munich. Tottenham mark their return to European football's top competition for the first time in six seasons, while Arsenal will aim to qualify for the knockout stages for a 13th successive year. Spurs, who reached the quarter-finals in 2010-11 with wins over both Milan clubs, have avoided the European heavyweights despite being drawn in pot three. With White Hart Lane's capacity reduced as work begins on a new stadium, Tottenham will play their Champions League games at Wembley this season. Their toughest test is likely to come against Russian champions CSKA Moscow, the 2005 Uefa Cup winners. \"We know very well that Russia is always difficult and CSKA are sure to have a very good team,\" said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino. Arsenal, who reached the last 16 last season, and PSG will be favourites to progress from Group A. French champions PSG knocked Chelsea out in the last 16 before losing to Manchester City, but have not met Arsenal since the 1993-94 Cup Winners' Cup semi-final. Group A: Paris St-Germain (France), Arsenal (England), Basel (Switzerland), Ludogorets (Bulgaria). Group B: Benfica (Portugal), Napoli (Italy), Dynamo Kiev (Ukraine), Besiktas (Turkey). Group C: Barcelona (Spain), Manchester City (England), Borussia Monchengladbach (Germany), Celtic (Scotland). Group D: Bayern Munich (Germany), Atletico Madrid (Spain), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rostov (Russia). Group E: CSKA Moscow (Russia), Bayer Leverkusen (Germany), Tottenham (England), Monaco (France). Group F: Real Madrid (Spain), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Sporting Lisbon (Portugal), Legia Warsaw (Poland).

Mr Jadhav was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of \"espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan\". Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying. India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress. There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained. Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran. Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as \"an indefensible verdict\" and warned Pakistan to \"consider the consequences\". Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do \"whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice\". On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death. Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to \"plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan\". He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution. The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories. In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India. It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad. But executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying. Sarabjit Singh, an Indian man sentenced to death for spying in 1991, died in prison in 2013 while on death row after an attack by other prisoners.",

    "source": "Dave and Leslie Blissett, of Lincolnshire, bought the Tornado GR1 - extensively involved in the 1991 conflict - as a shell. For sale on Gumtree, it has no engine, or guns and the wings have been removed for transportation purposes. The ex-RAF engineers, whose love of aeroplanes brought them together, said it would make an ideal museum display. Mr Blissett said he has always had a passion for taking things apart. He took on the project after being involved in the restoration of a Lightning jet at RAF Binbrook, near Market Rasen. \"What we started with was literally a bare frame - you couldn't recognise it as a Tornado,\" he said. \"Over the years we've bought, swapped and gone through scrap bins to get it to where it is now.\" Mrs Blissett said when it first arrived it looked like a \"metal caterpillar on the back of a lorry\". \"Some people go for garden gnomes, we go for aeroplanes,\" she said. The Panavia Tornado GR1 was used extensively in combat by the RAF in 1990s, including in the Gulf War in 1991. On the classified ads website, the couple have written: \"She is virtually complete and is ready to move as her wings have already been removed.\" Andrew Panton, manager of the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre, said it was \"unusual\" to sell aircraft on Gumtree, as they are generally sold via the Ministry of Defence surplus service. \"They way they are doing it - making it known worldwide - could work in their favour,\" he said. As interesting as the piece is, it is the \"wrong era\" for the centre in Spilsby, which focuses on World War II aircraft, he said.",

    "source": "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News. Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to \u00a31,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to \u00a3100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor. With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News. Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News. A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News. The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

    "source": "Sir Richard Leese is a senior figure in the drive to unite the north of England as an economic force. North Wales could benefit from better transport links and growth potential and the Welsh government had been supporting the development, he said. But Sir Richard also said the region \"needed more freedom\". \"Devolution to Wales has to go beyond the Welsh assembly,\" he told the BBC's Wales At Work programme. \"I'd argue Cardiff and its city region ought to be able to do some of the things we're doing in Greater Manchester. \"North Wales again needs to be given more power by the Welsh assembly to enable it to work better with us in the north of England.\" \"From the discussions I've had in north Wales, the growth potential is enormous but it's more likely to be realised if we can work out those synergies between what's happening in north Wales and just the other side of the border. \"They need to be given the freedom by the Welsh assembly to do that.\" The cities of the \"Northern Powerhouse\" stretch from Manchester and Liverpool to Sheffield, Leeds and Hull and up to Newcastle and Sunderland in the north east. Radical improvements to transport connections over the next 15 to 20 years could create a single labour market and \"virtual city\" of 15 million in the north of England, which could provide an economic counter-balance to London. Sir Richard, who is also chair of the Core Cities cabinet which includes Cardiff, said north Wales could also benefit from that and there was a recognition in Cardiff Bay that the links between north Wales and northern England were more important than those with south Wales. Sir Richard said energy production, advanced manufacturing and health innovation and digital industries were not just based in the urban cores and some of these sectors already existed in north Wales. \"North Wales has the opportunity to play into and contribute to those sectoral strengths of the north of England. \"For industry in north Wales its route to market is through the North of England. So what we're do to improve transport connections, there's a shared interest in extending that beyond the north of England.\" He said care had to be taken with comparisons, as Wales had the same population as Greater Manchester but he said areas like transport and business support might benefit from greater devolution within Wales. Tracy North, chair of the CBI in north Wales said company owners and managers wanted to be involved with the Northern Powerhouse but there was not an obvious body or mechanism for doing so. \"The CBI wants the next Welsh government to create a regional development corporation for north Wales,\" she said. \"It would need to be set up immediately after the election. It would have funding and staff, run in partnership with business and be unencumbered by local red tape. \"This way, the north Wales region can act independently to optimise economic opportunities, without going through the impracticality of discussing and voting on devolution, which would out of necessity take years and years.\" A Wales Office spokesman said it was committed to delivering a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people and communities of this country and wanted the Welsh government to \"have the same confidence and faith in Wales\". \"Only by giving local areas the powers and freedom they need can we further drive economic growth and create the jobs and investment opportunities this country needs,\" he said. The Welsh government said: \"As part of the Mersey Dee Alliance, we already recognise the economic importance of cross border working and links. We will work with the UK Government to ensure north Wales has full potential to exploit the maximum economic advantage from any Northern Powerhouse proposals.\"",

Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember. Experiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination. The research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology. But a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild. And another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids. The government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals. Falling numbers. Honey bees around the world are facing an uncertain future. They have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet. Now researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline. To investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee. Neonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States. Work carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity. Dr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more.  The same effects occur when we used organophosphates. \"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\" Another series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees. The researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food. Dr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\" 'No threat' She said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals. She explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die. \"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\" The European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators. But 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed. Ian Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\" He said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\". Dr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field. \"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained. \"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

Flint Community Hospital could be closed under plans by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) to reorganise its services in north Wales. Campaigners joined a protest march from the hospital to attend the public meeting at the town hall. In a statement BCUHB said retaining the status quo was \"not an option\". The health board, which predicts a financial shortfall of \u00c2\u00a364.6m this year, revealed details of its proposed shake-up in July. Under plans being considered Blaenau Ffestiniog community hospital could also close and minor injury accident departments may shut at other locations. Neo-natal intensive care may also be transferred over the border to England as part of the proposed shake-up. Shortly after the plans were made public GPs in the area revealed their concerns about the effects of proposed cuts on community services. Mark Scriven, the health board's medical director, said there was sound reasoning behind the proposals to close Flint hospital. \"The thinking generally about the problems we're trying to address in these proposals with community hospitals is that some of them are very old, and they have poor fabric,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. He said it was not just the furnishings that were not up to scratch, the physical space did not suit modern health care. \"A lot of them, and the services they provide, are underused, and certainly the minor injuries unit at Flint hospital is underused, which is important because it doesn't allow the nurses running it to maintain their experience according to their professional bodies,\" added Mr Scriven. In response, Jack Reece, chairman of the Save Our Cottage Hospital Campaign, said Flint hospital was well used. Speaking at Tuesday protest, he added: \"They've closed us, they took beds away from us. We've had 18 going down to 14, going down to 12, 10. \"They're taking away our clinics from there. They have systematically dropped the services from this town.\" Mr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government. Explaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still. \"The status quo is not an option,\" the board said. \"The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards. \"The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing.\" BCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions. Any changes would start in early 2013, it said.",

The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk. Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven. A fourth charge of acting \"dishonestly\" was found not proven. The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience. Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed \"significant crimes\" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act. Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent. \"[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected,\" he said. Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been \"clearly marked\" on official documents. In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt \"left out on a limb\". The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to \"burn out\" and that her life had become \"chaotic\" as a result. Ms Doherty, who had been subject to a suspension order since the allegations came to light in 2014, told the hearing she was not seeking to return to social care. A report by the care watchdog said: \"The committee finds that only a Removal Order will be adequate in this case given the seriousness of the impairment.\"",

In May, India's Supreme Court ruled that the power station could start operations as it was \"safe and secure\". Opponents of the plant, which is on the coastline hit by the 2004 Asian tsunami, fear a disaster similar to the one at Fukushima in Japan in 2011. Last year, Kudankalum was the scene of mass protests over safety concerns. But the government says the joint Indo-Russian project, which is seen as critical to India's energy needs, is \"necessary for the welfare and economic growth of India\" and is \"completely safe\". The plant is one of many that India hopes to build as part of its aim of generating 63,000 MW of nuclear power by 2032 - an almost 14-fold increase on current levels. The plant became operational during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's two-day visit to Moscow. Mr Singh was expected to finalise a deal with Russia for more reactors for the plant, but it fell through as Russia has refused to sign India's nuclear liability law. The law stipulates that nuclear firms aiming to set up plants in India will have to pay huge sums of money in case of an accident and Delhi and Moscow have not been able to agree on this clause.",

The small island in the Pacific is home to an important strategic US airbase, US nuclear bombers and about 6,000 troops along with some 165,000 civilians. It's a US territory, so an attack on Guam would be an attack on the US. The Guamanian authorities were quick to say there was nothing to fear from North Korea's angry rhetoric. \"I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island,\" Governor Eddie Baza Calvo said in a statement on Facebook, adding that the island was \"prepared for any eventuality\". But it has left many on the tourism-reliant island concerned. \"Yes, of course people are worried,\" front desk manager at a local hotel, Adele, told the BBC. \"It is scary to think that there is a threat from North Korea on Guam.\" Local stand-up comedian Chris \"Malafunkshun\" Barnett said there was a real level of anxiety: \"There have been threats before but this time feels different. \"We're really in caught in the cross fire. President Trump seems as much of a sabre-rattler as Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. \"And a lot of people here feel like Trump is the guy who might actually press the button.\" The story is all over the local media on Guam, adding to the nervousness of the residents. \"We should all prepare for whatever happens,\" Adele suggested, adding that she planned to stock up on food after work, in case the crisis escalated. \"Many people are taking such precautions. We're keeping an eye on the news and we're all praying that the military will help us.\" Isa Baza, a local television reporter, said the authorities believe it would take about 14 to 15 minutes for a North Korean missile to reach Guam. \"And so, that's not a lot of time to respond,\" she told the BBC. But Ms Baza added that the Guam Homeland Security Office \"did say that if there were any threat they would put out a mass public notification via the emergency broadcasting system\". It is not the first time the small island has found itself named as a potential target for North Korean rockets - aside from US military bases in South Korea or Japan, the Pacific island is the closest target for Pyongyang should the regime want to attack the US. Congresswoman for Guam Madeleine Z Bordallo said in a statement the most recent threat was \"dangerous and it further heightens tensions in our region\". She went on to criticise President Trump for his \"unhelpful\" tweeting on the matter and \"strongly urged\" him to \"explore every avenue\" to peacefully respond. But while local media are citing many residents sharing the heightened concern, not everyone is fazed by the situation. \"It's not a big deal,\" Cathleen Viray, another hotel worker, told the BBC. End of Twitter post  by @MALAFUNKSHUN. She pointed out that such threats were not new and that people had been living with this situation for a couple of years already. Local dive instructor Yuka, who caters mostly for Japanese tourists, agreed with her. People were concerned, she said, but said she herself was not too worried. \"There's a sense of resignation among many people here,\" Mr Barnett agrees. \"After all, we're talking about a possible nuclear strike here. \"But I think this is moving too far too fast - and that we haven't really given diplomacy a chance yet.\"",

Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski made fine saves to keep Stewart Downing and Jordan Rhodes out before the break. Rhodes then went closest to winning it, hitting the post after the break. Boro's 22nd Championship clean sheet of the season was enough to extend their unbeaten run to eight games, but their profligacy sees them wedged between Burnley and Brighton in the race for automatic promotion to the Premier League with two games remaining. Ipswich's hopes of finishing in the top six were unlikely even before kick-off, with Sheffield Wednesday moving nine points clear in the last remaining play-off spot with a 1-1 draw at Derby County. Ghana international Albert Adomah and \u00a39m February arrival Rhodes - denied in a one-on-one by Bialkowski in the 34th minute - were particularly bright for Boro in the first half, while defender Paul Digby, making his first Ipswich start, made a crucial tackle to foil Emilio Nsue before half-time. Gaston Ramirez was industrious for Boro after the break, and helped create the best chance of the game, only for Rhodes to hit the inside of the post after beating Bialkowski.

The two-page note describes how the couple met, were chased by a photographer in Prince Philip's sports car and danced at London nightclubs. It was given a pre-auction estimate of \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200 but sold for \u00a314,400. Describing it as a \"fantastic result\", Richard Edmonds of the Chippenham Auction Rooms in Wiltshire said: \"It was quite an honour to be able to sell such an important document, particularly as the country is celebrating the Queen's 90th birthday. \"The bidding was both online and over eight phone lines. It was pretty fast and furious. At times our internet connection looked like it was lighting up.\" The identity of the buyer has not been disclosed. The then Princess Elizabeth agreed to share the details of her relationship with Philip, for a royal wedding souvenir book being written by Mrs Shew. In the letter, written in ink on white paper adorned with the royal crest, the princess recalls how she met Prince Philip at the age of 13, describes his love of fast cars and how the couple danced at nightclubs Ciro's and Quaglino's in London. The future Queen also writes about her wedding ring, which she says will be made of Welsh gold. She and Prince Philip married in November 1947 at Westminster Abbey, the same location as her coronation in June 1953.",

Rosberg said: \"Every weekend is crucial but the results momentum is on his side and I need to try to turn it around. \"Definitely that is the case. I have come here to win, to try to extend the lead in the championship.\" Lewis Hamilton has completed 169 racing laps out of a possible 224 this year (following his retirement from the Australian GP). Of those, he has spent 164 in the lead (97%). Hamilton is four points behind his team-mate in the drivers' standings and the Mercedes car has such a performance advantage that the two are effectively competing for wins only with each other at every race. Hamilton said: \"This is a much more intense season so far and perfection is required every weekend to get that result, especially when you have a good team-mate who is also doing an exceptional job.\" Hamilton has out-qualified Rosberg in three of the four races so far this season, each time when there was a wet qualifying session. Rosberg said: \"What I need is a normal weekend and then I'm sure I'll be able to turn things around.\" Both men said they expected the nature of Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya could mean they face a tougher challenge from their rivals than has been the case so far. Long, demanding corners predominate at the track, which is renowned as one of the severest tests of a car's aerodynamic capabilities on the Formula 1 calendar. The competitive order may also shift as Barcelona is a race where teams traditionally bring their first big upgrade package of the year. Hamilton said: \"It depends what step they make but the Red Bulls are at the back of my mind. \"They have perhaps a little more downforce than us, they just don't have as much power. \"This is very much a downforce-dependent circuit, so you'll get a real good indication of how good their car is.\" Alonso finished third in the last race in China after a troubled start to the season for Ferrari, but said he would not start the weekend of his home race expecting to repeat that result. \"We will do our best but we know it will be a tough weekend. Today, sitting here, if I tell you I will fight for the podium, I would lie to you and I don't want to do that for all the people coming,\" said the 32-year-old, a hero for the tens of thousands of Spanish fans who flock to the race. Four-time champion Vettel, who has been beaten by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in the last two races and is struggling to adapt to the new Red Bull, said: \"Mercedes are in a very strong position. They are difficult to beat, but it's never impossible. \"At the moment there are a couple of things we need to get on top of and then it should be a different story.\" Spanish Grand Prix coverage details.",

    "source": "MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success. Every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge. Media playback is not supported on this device. The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants. I don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish. It is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring. The only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do. One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it. I am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007. Despite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title. Near-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though. He addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing. Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there. His midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly. Chelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager. By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days. They were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games. Their players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop. That underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race. Even when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in. That was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time. They have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control. They have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea. When you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front. I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them. Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available. That includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player. At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game. Media playback is not supported on this device. The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit. Compare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together. Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice. They were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals. But in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back. From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull. So they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table. I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example. The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that. None of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin. City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while. Chelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title. They have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard. Put all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull. They have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota. Media playback is not supported on this device. The only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease. He has his third title in English football, and now he will want more. He can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer. I am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out. Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going. But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come. Alan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Lord Janner was accused of abuse allegations during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s - but was deemed unfit to stand trial in England because of dementia. The former MP has consistently denied all allegations against him. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the allegation had first been made in 1991 by a Leicester man who told police that Greville Janner sexually abused him during the 1970s - including in Scotland. Police in Leicestershire investigated allegations against the politician - who represented two constituencies in Leicester between 1970 and 1997 - in the 1990s but no charges were brought, he added. However Scottish police have reviewed files from the original claim relating to the alleged abuse in Scotland and are now carrying out their own investigation, our correspondent said. \"Because Scotland has a separate and independent prosecutor, it would be able to make its own decision about whether to charge Lord Janner,\" he added. In April, the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales, Alison Saunders, decided allegations against the peer by nine men were strong enough to merit a prosecution. However, she said the prosecution should not go ahead because Lord Janner would to be unable to take part in his defence due to his poor health. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service, covering England and Wales, said it would review the decision. A senior prosecutor unconnected to the original case will review the decision. Justice Lowell Goddard - who is leading an independent inquiry into child sex abuse - has also said she would investigate claims against Lord Janner.",

Satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habitually breed forms late or is absent. Scientists report the observations in the online journal Plos One. They reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites. These are further in towards the coast, up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that jut out over the ocean. It is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places. But somehow, the emperors find a way up to breed, and also to come and go as they forage for the seafood that will sustain their chicks. \"We thought that in years when the sea ice was bad, they just didn't breed, but they're clearly more adaptable than that,\" said lead author Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey. The emperor is the most southerly of the Antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter. Their reliance on these thin seasonal marine floes as a reproductive platform, coupled with concern about how the patterns of Antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world, has led to the species being designated as \"near threatened\" on the IUCN red list. Currently, the extent of winter sea ice in the Antarctic is growing year by year, albeit slowly. The coverage does however vary considerably by region, and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century. But this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead. In the observations of Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, for example, the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30m-high cliff. \"When they go out from the colony to forage, they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea. We're not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down,\" Mr Fretwell told BBC News. \"But this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way, likely through an ice creek. This route is 5km longer and we know they take it because we can see their tracks in the satellite pictures.\" There is a big opportunity here to go study these penguins which have yet to be visited by an expedition. There is obviously some cost to going up on the ice shelves - they are windier and the birds must travel further to forage. If that cost was not there, they would habitually breed on the shelves rather than the temperamental thin floes.  But how big this cost is and how beneficial is the observed adaptation in years of poor sea ice has yet to be properly established. Co-author Barbara Wienecke from the Australian Antarctic Division said: \"These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals. However, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. \"The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. \"We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Ancient cities around the shores of the Mediterranean and Adriatic are on the front line, their stone streets squeezed full of summer visitors as budget airlines and giant cruise ships unload ever-growing armies of tourists. Take the Croatian city of Dubrovnik: a perfectly preserved historical miniature, carved from honey-coloured stone set in a sea of postcard blue. Around 1,500 people live within the walls of its Old City, custodians of cultural treasures left by everyone from the Romans and the Ostrogoths to the Venetians and the Habsburgs. On a busy day three modern cruise ships, each one the size of a floating apartment building, can disgorge five or six times that number of people into the city. They join the throngs of tourists staying in local hotels and in rooms rented over the internet, in streets where almost every elegant stone house has been converted into a B&B. The overall effect is Disneylandish - a sense that you meet no-one but other tourists or ice-cream sellers, tour guides, waiters, reception clerks and buskers who are there to keep the tourist wheels turning. Mark Thomas, who edits The Dubrovnik Times, explains the phenomenon like this. \"When I first got here, I'd stand back if I saw that people were taking photographs of each other. Now there are so many people that I know if I did that, I'd never get anywhere here.\" Dubrovnik has a particular problem because its ancient appeal has now been bolstered by that most modern of phenomena - the HBO mini-series. The city, unchanged for centuries, provides the main locations for Game of Thrones. Fans come on pilgrimages to visit the settings. One souvenir shop owner, who told me he doesn't watch the series himself, admitted he had Googled a couple of catchphrases to help attract customers. \"It does seem crazy,\" he admitted, \"to stand here when it's 35 degrees, shouting that 'Winter is Coming'.\" Dubrovnik is not alone in struggling to balance its need for tourists' money with the need to ensure that those tourists don't end up destroying the beauty they've come to see. The tiny Italian island of Capri has warned that it could \"explode\" under the pressure of the trade that sees as many as 15,000 visitors a day travelling by boat from the mainland, to visit its once-idyllic streets and squares. One local official told The Daily Telegraph: \"You can't fit a litre-and-a-half into a litre pot.\" Florence, Barcelona and some Greek islands like Santorini have suffered too, and it was perhaps Venice which experienced the problem first. Its population has been falling since the 1950s, effectively forced out by the hordes of cruise-ship visitors. Tourism, of course, remains essentially a good thing and in the developed world we nearly all do it. It means trade and cultural exchange and it's both a symbol of rising prosperity and a generator of future wealth. Part of the \"problem\" is that travellers from traditional sources like the UK, Germany and the USA are increasingly being joined by the new middle classes of countries like Russia, China and India. Add to that the issue of security, which means that many tourists feel safer in Europe than they do in alternative destinations like Tunisia, Turkey or Egypt, and it's hard to see the numbers falling any time soon. It will fall to local governments in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice to find a way of reducing those growing pressures. For now, ideas like installing turnstiles on ancient squares and pedestrian traffic lights on crowded streets may sound rather fanciful. But if that tourist tide keeps rising they might start to seem a little more tempting.",

Chief executive Gary Hetherington told BBC Radio Leeds: \"It is looking like \u00a31m in total. It has caused massive disruption. \"But sport throws up all sorts of challenges and this is another one.\" All seven training pitches and the main building at the Kirkstall site the Rhinos share with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie were contaminated by flood water at the end of December. The Rhinos, who begin the defence of their Super League title against Warrington on 4 February, say that 80 members of staff based at the site, plus 120 players, have been kept out for the last month. \"We couldn't get anywhere near the site,\" said Hetherington. \"When we were able to access it, the reality hit everybody. The whole site was under water. The changing rooms, medical rooms and gymnasium, and all the equipment was completely destroyed. \"All the pitches are contaminated so they need to be dug up and reseeded. The 3G pitch needs to be replaced. The buildings need to be replastered, all the floors need to come up. \"It will be the best part of six months before we can use the grass pitches and gymnasium.\"",

Veterans for Justice UK expect about 100 former soldiers to take part in a march through the city next month. Organisers said it was to highlight \"injustices against soldiers\". Mr Kelly said the march by British Army veterans on 4 March \"must not be allowed to happen\". \"Clearly, this is an act of pure provocation and is totally insensitive to the nationalist population. It's a deliberate insult,\" he said. \"Its organisers should think carefully about the effect this could have on bereaved families here, families still reeling from the crimes of the past, not to mention the ordinary citizens of this city.\" Thirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972, and a 14th victim died later, after troops opened fire on a civil rights march. Speaking on behalf of the Bloody Sunday Trust, Minty Thompson said holding the march in Derry was a \"deliberately provocative act\". \"This city has clearly been chosen because it was the scene of one of the most horrific acts of state violence in our history, Bloody Sunday, and because soldiers who were involved in that event, who shot down innocent and unarmed people on our streets, are at long last being investigated for their actions,\" he said. The Northern Ireland branch of the Veterans for Justice UK group was established in December 2015. Anto Wickham, who is organising the Derry march, said their aims were to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing \"false prosecutions\". \"If soldiers break the law then they face the rigours of the law and rightly so, and it's the same as it should be for any other member of the community,\" he said. \"But where's the investigation into my colleagues and friends who were murdered? It just seems to be forgotten about.\" The former Royal Irish Regiment soldier added the marches were planned in 2016 as part of a larger campaign to put pressure on the government. Mr Wickham said he was \"upset\" by suggestions the march was planned to raise tensions in the city. \"I understand the families and the victims are still really hurt and they want prosecutions. \"If that's the case, and there is evidence, then you have to face the rigours of the law but that should also be the same with the IRA.\" The prosecution of those involved in killings is a major stumbling block in efforts to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Last month, the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland said critics who accused him of treating former soldiers unfairly had insulted him and his office. Barra McGrory QC said he was mystified by claims he did not act impartially when he brought charges against a small number of ex-soldiers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing former soldiers facing prosecution have said they are being 'unfairly treated'.",

But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims. He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend. Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug. \"He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,\" said Mr Findlay of the attack. \"Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: \"I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. \"I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. \"It is all very well saying 'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.\" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation. In a statement. Gordonstoun said: \"We welcome the Scottish Abuse Inquiry's invitation to submit a report and will respond in full. \"Cases of non-recent abuse must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and their families and the work that the Scottish Abuse Inquiry is undertaking will, we hope, draw important lessons from the past and make children safer in the future. \"For everyone at Gordonstoun today, making sure our students are happy, healthy and safe is at the heart of everything we do. \"We are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all our students. Our ongoing work in this area was recognised in our most recent independent Care Inspectorate Report which gave us a rating of five -  'very good' - for pupil care and support and noted the 'comprehensive child protection procedures' in place.\" The Scottish government said it had established one of the widest ranging public inquiries that Scotland has ever seen into the abuse of children in care. A spokesperson said: \"It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. \"We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. \"Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. \"We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of \u00c2\u00a313.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.\" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject. The spokesperson added: \"Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.\"",

The adjournment was granted by Mr Justice Birss until 21 December, with the completion of the purchase agreement due on 16 December. He approved Lotus' application for the adjournment, which was backed by Renault Sport and not resisted, because the proposed deal was the result most likely to be of benefit to the creditors and the best chance of rescuing the business as a going concern. Other creditors, owed in excess of \u00a32m, would be paid by 31 December, counsel Jeremy Bamford told the court.

In October, RBSS member Ibrahim Abdul Qader was killed by IS militants, along with fellow journalist Fares Hamadi, in south-eastern Turkey. IS subsequently published a video showing one of the men with his throat cut, and warned: \"You will not be safe from the knife of the Islamic State. Our hand will reach you wherever you are.\" RBSS is one of the few independent sources of news left in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, which IS has controlled since August 2013 and serves as the de facto capital of the \"caliphate\" whose creation the group proclaimed in June 2014.",

His retirement comes after a report by Prof John Drew found the force's response to the abuse was \"inadequate\". It was commissioned after the Jay Report found 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. In a brief statement, South Yorkshire Police said: \"The chief constable's contract runs until November. He will retire after 31 years in policing.\" Prof Drew's report, which was published on Wednesday, said the force \"regularly missed\" opportunities to tackle the problem of abuse and had \"seriously under-resourced\" its early work. The report also said several attempts to alert senior officers to the issue fell on \"deaf ears\". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed it was looking into 200 allegations about the conduct of police relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. It also said it had 55 ongoing investigations linked to at least 66 officers in South Yorkshire and had received more than 100 allegations linked to officers who have not yet been identified. In a statement, the IPCC said: \"From the moment the IPCC wrote to South Yorkshire Chief Constable David Crompton to advise him of our expectations for referrals following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014, the number of allegations and number of officers involved has steadily increased. \"We first announced an investigation in November 2014 and that related to allegations raised in the Jay Report against 10 officers.\" Aside from the issue of abuse in Rotherham, Mr Crompton also faced criticism when Sir Cliff Richard's home was searched in connection with an inquiry into alleged child abuse in 2014. The force co-operated with the BBC to enable live TV coverage of the raid, which an independent report found had \"interfered with his [Sir Cliff's} privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress\". Mr Crompton took over the chief constable role in 2012 from Meredydd Hughes after he retired from the post.",

A total of 98 refugees have now arrived in Northern Ireland since the conflict. The first group of Syrian refugees arrived in December 2015. The war in Syria has claimed the lives of more than 250,000 people. Some of the refugees in Derry were at the North West Regional College on Tuesday to find out more about learning courses. Bayan Khello, 18, had to leave many of her family behind including her brother who is currently in Germany. Bayan spoke to BBC Radio Foyle through an interpreter. \"I still have family in Turkey and Aleppo, the sons of my cousin are still there, we have put in an application to have our family unified here. \"My uncle and my cousin were killed in the war. My cousin was going back from his work when a sniper shot him in the chest. That was one of my worst days,\" she said. Bayan, who wears a free Syria wristband in the colours of her native country, said she did not want to leave her home. \"I didn't want to leave Aleppo, I wasn't eating for two months. Then my father told me 'We have to live our life now, we have to make a new start'. \"I saw houses knocked down with children underneath, its time to end this war, its enough.\" Bayan, who has a degree in accountancy, said she does not yet know what kind of life she will have in Northern Ireland, but she wants to study hard and learn English. Yasser Al Satton left his home in Syria after chemical weapons were used in the area. \"Within the last month the house of one my relations was bombed and ten people were killed. \"Everything that comes to your mind, we lived it and we saw it. One of my relation's lost both of his hands when a bomb exploded. \"If we had hope that the war would end we would have stayed but I don't believe the war will end,\" he said. Yasser said that he was adjusting to his new life in the North West very well. A particular highlight was how friendly the people of Derry have been. \"Everybody says: 'Hello, how are you, how are you doing, what's the craic?\" he added.",

The arrivals come with Cammy Bell, last season's first-choice goalkeeper, possibly leaving Tannadice to return to Kilmarnock. Bell, 30, is believed to be keen on a move to the Scottish Premiership club. McKinnon said of Lewis: \"I expect him to challenge for the starting position. \"Harry comes here as one of the top young goalkeeping prospects in English football. \"It says so much about his ambition and desire that he has chosen to come up to Scotland to get first-team involvement. \"It is a coup for us to bring him to Tannadice and I am positive we will hear much more about him during his career.\" Lewis, who has represented England at youth level, joined Southampton from hometown club Shrewsbury Town in 2015, hopes to challenge for starts with the Scottish Championship club. \"I am excited at the prospect of being involved in first-team football,\" he told United's website. \"I believe I am joining a winning team that will be challenging at the top of the league and want to play my part in helping the club secure the title.\" Stanton becomes United's ninth summer signing and their fourth of the week.

    "source": "Under the proposals, 120,000 additional asylum seekers will be distributed among EU nations, with binding quotas. It comes after a surge of thousands of mainly Syrian migrants pushed north through Europe in recent days. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament it was \"not a time to take fright\". Germany, the main destination for many migrants, supports quotas, but some EU countries oppose a compulsory system. Mr Juncker's plans were set out in a \"state of the union\" annual address in which he outlined the priorities of the European Commission. He opened his speech by admitting the European Union was \"not in a good situation. There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union\". He said tackling the crisis was \"a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective. \"This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population.\" The mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden. On Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden. In southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway. Among Mr Juncker's proposals:. \"It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed,\" he told MEPs. The new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain. The numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed. Countries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties. 14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda. 15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda. European Parliament then to decide on any new asylum measures with EU governments. Early 2016: EU proposals for better management of legal migration to EU due. What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Peston: Why Germany needs migrants more than UK. What can the EU do to solve the crisis? Nine key moments in crisis. The other exodus to Germany - people from the Balkans. Migrant crisis in pictures. Are you affected by the crisis? Spain on Wednesday said it would accept a quota of almost 15,000 extra migrants migrants set by EU. However Mr Juncker's proposals was criticised by both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said compulsory quotas were \"not a good solution\", while his Slovak counterpart called them \"irrational\". Poland and Romania have also opposed the idea, although Poland has agreed to take in more migrants. France welcomed the first of 1,000 migrants it has pledged to take from Germany, having committed to receive 24,000 migrants over two years. In a separate development Australia has announced plans to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees. Germany has welcomed Syrian migrants, waiving EU rules and saying it expects to deal with 800,000 asylum seekers this year alone - though not all will qualify as refugees and some will be sent back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany needed to learn from its mistakes in labelling incomers in the post-war period as \"Gastarbeiter\" or \"guest workers\" - with the implication that they were not permanent residents. Many of the refugees it expects in future \"will become new citizens of our country\", she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

    "source": "Mr Lewandowski is charged with simple battery over his encounter with former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Police allege that on 8 March after a news conference in Florida, he grabbed her arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise. Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, the Trump campaign said. Police in Jupiter, Florida, where he was arrested, have released new footage of the alleged assault. The security video appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him. \"Mr Lewandowksi is absolutely innocent of this charge,\" the Trump statement said. \"He is completely confident that he will be exonerated.\" Mr Trump himself has defended Mr Lewandowski on Twitter, saying the police footage shows there was \"nothing there\". If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign. A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses. The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however. Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz. Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway. The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz. Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president. Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions. He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465. Ohio Governor John Kasich is some way behind with 143, with the 1,237 needed to win the nomination probably out of his reach. The 40-year hurt - how Bruce Springsteen articulated the forces that underpin the rise of Trump. Trumpisms - 22 things that Trump believes. Donald v George Bush - How extreme is Trump? A civil war - Lifelong Republicans turned off by Trump. Mr Cruz's campaign responded to the arrest by lamenting the \"abusive behaviour\" that they said seems to be part of the Trump campaign culture. That appeared to be an allusion to the. Around the time of the incident between Mr Lewandowski and Ms Fields, Mr Trump was on the defensive over violence committed by supporters against protesters at his rallies. In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton will try in Wisconsin to stem the momentum of a resurgent Bernie Sanders, who is on a roll after a string of wins.",

    "source": "The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that 2,500 homes were repossessed in April, May and June, down from 3,000 in the previous quarter. This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. \"This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular,\" said CML director general Paul Smee. \"As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening.\" Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than \u00c2\u00a31.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said. Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance. Ministry of Justice figures, also published on Thursday, show that the number of homeowners in England and Wales facing court action at the earliest stage of the repossession process fell during the second quarter of the year. However, the number of tenants evicted by landlords in the second quarter of the year rose by 4% compared with the same period last year, to 10,361. Seasonally adjusted figures show a 1% decrease compared to the first three months of the year. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: \"These figures are a stark warning that relentless rent rises and welfare cuts have contributed to thousands of hard-pressed families losing their home.\"",

    "source": "Levein, the club's director of football, described finishing fifth in the Premiership, as \"frustrating and a tad disappointing\". \"I've got high hopes for him [Cathro],\" Levein said. \"This is a tough place to manage, as I know myself. \"The thing about here is the players like him.\" Levein points to mistakes in the January transfer window which saw Hearts sign nine players - six of whom have since left the club - as a chief reason for the underwhelming league campaign. Dylan Bikey, Tasos Avlonitis, Lennard Sowah, Andraz Struna and Alexandros Tziolis are all moving on while Moha Choulay is returning to parent club Stoke City. \"Rushed is probably a fair assessment,\" Levein explained. \"We've had six transfer windows since the club came out of administration [in 2014]. Four of them have been really good, the last two haven't been particularly good. \"In hindsight, should we have given longer-term contracts to some of those players? The answer is probably no. \"The fact we gave them short-term contracts has allowed us to still be in a position to be able to strengthen this summer and repair some of the damage.\" Levein says the \"furore\" surrounding 30-year-old Cathro since his arrival has been tough for the young head coach to deal with, but says the players enjoy working under him and will improve next season. \"For him to be a real success here we need to give him time and let him understand what this is all about,\" Levein explained. \"Then we can let him go and play how he wants to play, but we need to fix some other things first. \"His problem early on has been understanding Scottish football, not understanding how he wants to play. \"In this country just now, Celtic are in a class of their own, Rangers play a different style of football to other teams, but the rest play the same. \"If you can't deal with long balls, second balls, wide crosses, then you can't impose yourself on the match. \"His early experiences have been about understanding that part of it. Once he deals with that part of it I think it will allow his coaching abilities to come to the fore.\"",

    "source": "Tory MP David Davis said news of the proposed in-work benefits ban could encourage workers to head to the UK. Sir Eric Pickles, a Eurosceptic who supports Mr Cameron's reform proposals, said action had to be taken to prevent a \"new influx\" of migrants. The ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February. It will be graduated, so that the longer migrant workers stay in the UK, the more in-work benefits, such as tax credits, they will be entitled to, in order to top-up their wages. EU referendum: PM faces grassroots anger over EU vote. Mr Cameron says the move will \"make a difference\" to high levels of immigration by reducing a \"pull factor\". But it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an \"emergency brake\". If Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June. David Davis, a former Tory leadership contender and leading Eurosceptic, said eastern European newspapers had carried numerous stories about the plan to terminate in-work benefits for the first four years after a migrant's arrival in the UK. At the same time, he said, Brussels has suggested the scheme could take 12 months to implement. \"Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect,\" he said. \"Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months.\" Mr Cameron has suggested the \"emergency brake\" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it. Eric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: \"What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union.\" The reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining \"something for nothing\" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax. But Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: \"Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen.\" Meanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had \"never been an 'outer'\". Bernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: \"He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before.\" Other potential Tory \"outers\" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a \"load of rubbish\" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it \"would be wonderful\" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it. He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences. He said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on \"identity and immigration,\" while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an \"optimistic, upbeat internationalist message\". A third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign. One of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO \"umbrella,\" and it was possible for them all to to operate as \"one happy family\".",

    "source": "The head of city centre regeneration is set to receive the largest increase of 20%, leading to a salary of \u00a375,000. A council document said it reflected \"increased responsibility\" due to \"additional city centre development\". But, the Taxpayers' Alliance said people wanted to see lower council tax rates, not large pay rises for bosses. Councillor John Flanagan said the rises affected eight posts and would be funded \"from within existing budgets\". Seven other senior bosses could earn a pay rise of about 7%. Despite the disappointing performance of Manchester's schools over recent years, the strategic director of education and skills will get a pay rise of 7.6%. That will take their new salary to \u00a3125,000 per year. As for other council staff, there are around 1,300 employees who are paid the living wage of \u00a38.25 per hour - and the average council salary is \u00a323,000 a year. In addition to that, most city council employees were given a pay rise of just 1% earlier this year. The council have had to cope with huge cuts worth around \u00a3300m a year over the past six years. That has meant a reduction in staff from around 10,000 - to fewer than 6,000 today. Mr Flanagan, executive member for finance, said: \"It is essential that we can keep and attract the right calibre of senior staff by having salaries which reflect the levels of responsibility they have and are in line with those available in comparable cities. \"We are currently reviewing all staff salaries, from top to bottom, to ensure they fairly reflect their workloads and responsibility, while maintaining value for money for council taxpayers.\" Harry Davis, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the council had been \"really good over the last half decade\" over pay issues. \"They have removed about 400 staff earning over \u00a350,000,\" he said. \"But, when savings need to be made and council tax is still going up, they have to make sure that they keep a tight grip on the purse strings so that they can channel as much as possible to front line services and tax cuts for local residents.\"",

    "source": "It comes after a dispute over whether Wales had the power to set minimum wages, or if that right laid with the UK government. UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve originally blocked a law passed by AMs last year, saying it was not within the assembly's powers. UK ministers said they were grateful for clarity on the issue. The dispute arose after the assembly passed a law last year to set minimum wages, and the terms and conditions, of agricultural workers in Wales after the UK government abolished the Agricultural Wages Board, which had regulated the sector. On Wednesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said the \"significant\" Supreme Court judgment \"goes some way to clarifying the complexities of the current devolution settlement\". The Welsh government said it could now create an Agricultural Advisory Panel to set minimum wage levels and \"promote skills development and career progression\" in farming. But the first minister warned \"we cannot continue to have bill after bill\" referred to the Supreme Court \"with all the time, cost and uncertainty that involves\". He called for Wales to move to a form of devolution where powers are assumed to rest with the assembly in cases like this, unless legislation specifically rules this out. Welsh Secretary David Jones said UK ministers were \"grateful to the Supreme Court for providing clarity on this issue\" and they would \"study the judgment in detail and consider its implications\". \"In its judgment, the court has favoured a broader interpretation of the provisions in the Government of Wales Act that govern the assembly's competence,\" he said. David Jones said UK ministers would \"continue to make every effort to ensure that the legislative arrangements for Welsh devolution work effectively.\" Assembly Shadow Rural Affairs Minister Russell George blamed \"rushed\" legislation for much of the confusion over the agricultural bill producing \"sloppy law-making, doubts over competence, and months of uncertainty for Welsh farmers\". Plaid Cymru agriculture spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said: \"The case for moving to a reserved powers model has been made and has been accepted by all parties in the assembly, and adopting this model would avoid these unnecessary delays.\" Liberal Democrat Eluned Parrott agreed Wales should move to a form of devolution more like the Scottish system that had received \"no legal challenges at all to Scottish legislation\" since 1999.",

They shouldn't be playing again.\" Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco. \"The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,\" he added. \"You never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that. \"I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\" The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. \"Your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. \"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\" Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne. \"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said. \"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. Dame Margaret Hodge's review said it would be better to ditch the Garden Bridge than risk uncertain costs. Three months ago the Garden Bridge Trust admitted its future was in doubt after publishing accounts which showed a \u00a370m shortfall in funding. Initially \u00a360m of public money was pledged on planning for the bridge. Transport for London pledged \u00a330m, but \u00a320m of that was to be a loan, and the rest was from central government. Dame Margaret says \u00a337.4m had already been spent, and even if the bridge did not go ahead it would cost the taxpayer \u00a346.4m. The Garden Bridge Trust said it was seeking a meeting with the London mayor to discuss next steps, but added the trust was \"determined\" to make the bridge happen. Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking and Dagenham and former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was asked to examine the project by London Mayor, Sadiq Khan in September. On Friday, Dame Margaret said: \"Value for money for the taxpayer has not been secured. \"It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.\" Dame Margaret said decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers' money. Her review also found costs spiralling out of control from an early estimate of \u00a360m to over \u00a3200m now. Moreover, the review found the \"risk to the taxpayer has intensified\", while the original ambition to \"fund the Garden Bridge through private finance has been abandoned\". Other findings include:. Dame Margaret's review criticised the tendering process for the design of the Garden Bridge created by the previous City Hall administration. It stated architects the Heatherwick Studio were given a head start in the process having already been closely associated with the project for five months before invitations to tender were sent out. Two other firms that took part in the tendering process - Wilkinson Eyre and Marks Barfield - were given just eight working days to submit designs, the review said. David Marks, co-director of Marks Barfield, told the BBC: \"This competition didn't smell right from the start. It is clear that we were just there to make up the numbers and the outcome of this tender had in reality already been pre-determined. \"Had Marks Barfield been aware of Heatherwick Studios' involvement and original idea, we would certainly not have submitted a tender. \"We've never been asked to do something in such a short space of time.\" This is 40 pages of brutal, uncompromising criticism of nearly every part of the once flagship Garden Bridge project. I can't remember reading a report so damning of a transport project. Procurement, finances, business cases, value for money, previous mayors, deputy mayors and transport officials get an absolutely withering assessment. This was meant to be an oasis of green calm hanging above the Thames. Now a report has basically recommended it be cancelled and the taxpayer take a hit on a project whose overall cost is now upwards of \u00a3200m. It will be very difficult for the project to withstand this. The big question now is will the present Mayor Sadiq Khan just let it wither or kill it? Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: \"We will be studying the report in detail and seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss next steps. \"The Trust remains as determined as ever to make the Garden Bridge happen which will bring huge benefits to London and the UK.\" A City Hall spokesman said: \"The Mayor has been absolutely clear that he will not spend any more of London taxpayers' funds on the Garden Bridge. \"It is the Garden Bridge Trust that remains responsible for raising the necessary funds, and delivering the project.\"",

The findings, reported in the journal Science, could lead to cheaper and greener cars, planes and electronics. It is the first time that durable \"thermoset\" plastic has been produced in a recyclable form. Dr Jeanette Garcia, from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, stumbled upon the first new class of thermosets in many years when she accidentally left one of three components out of a reaction. \"I had this chunk of plastic, and I had to figure out what it was,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"I had to smash my round-bottomed flask with a hammer.\" That chunk of plastic, produced from unexpectedly simple ingredients, proved to be tremendously hard and stable. Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components. This digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused. \"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\" But her search turned up nothing. This was new. Once she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said. Because they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites. Yet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled. \"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\". Dr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away. \"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\" Beyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\" As well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties. \"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"",

    "source": "The skeleton of \"Thankerton Man\" was found in a stone cist - a type of burial chamber - at Boatbridge Quarry, Thankerton, South Lanarkshire, in 1970. It was radiocarbon-dated to between 2460BC and 2140BC and thought to have been that of a man aged 18 to 25. The reconstructed image will go on show at the Biggar and Upper Clydesdale Museum, which opens on Tuesday. The reconstruction was produced by specialists from Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) who worked from detailed analysis of the skull. Caroline Erolin, lecturer in forensic and medical art at CAHID, said: \"Given its age, the skeleton of Thankerton Man was in excellent condition, which allowed us to get a strong impression of how he may have looked. \"Once we built the basic shape of his face we then looked at historical data to get a better idea of how a man would have looked at that time. For instance, we know they had the ability to shave.\" The estimated height of the man was around 1.8 metres (5ft 11ins), which is regarded as tall in Copper Age terms. The cist contained a finely-decorated beaker which had held food or drink for the deceased's journey into the afterlife. The pot and skeleton are curated by National Museums Scotland. Dr Alison Sheridan, principal curator of early prehistory at National Museums Scotland, who provided archaeological advice, praised the reconstruction. She said: \"This is a magnificent piece of work that really brings the past to light. It has spurred us on to arrange the DNA analysis of this man's remains.\"",

    "source": "Members were unable to reach a compromise after eight hours of talks. The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected his own top team. Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour \"put the band back together\" for a possible early election. A proposal  to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday's leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15. Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool. Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a \"very positive meeting\". He added: \"We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in.\" Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table. Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections. The Labour leader has said there is a \"thirst for democracy\" in the party and he backs a \"widening of the franchise\". Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote. He described their participation as \"unpopular\" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs. In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid \u00c2\u00a33 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn. This time around, they were asked to pay \u00c2\u00a325 to take part. Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday. Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience. Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters. Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been \"rushed\" and \"unpopular\". He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party. \"We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,\" he said. Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be. But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected. Arriving at the NEC meeting in central London earlier, veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner accused the media of \"trying to get rid of\" Mr Corbyn.",

    "source": "Investigations were suspended in 2011 after a critical report into the running of the office. The report found that the independence of the office had been compromised. Many of the cases involve allegations of security force collusion. At the time the ombudsman was Al Hutchinson. The critical report into his office was carried out by the then criminal justice inspector, Michael Maguire, who replaced Mr Hutchinson as police ombudsman in July 2012. The report said there had been a lowering of operational independence between the ombudsman and the police, and that investigations into historical events should be suspended. The criticism contributed to the early retirement of Mr Hutchinson. A follow-up inspection report published on Wednesday concluded that enough improvements have been made for historical investigations to resume. Dr Maguire said his previous role had given him an \"understanding of the issues that needed to be addressed\". \"The office has worked very hard over the last year to put some of those issues in a way which repositions the office to be able to recommence these investigations again,\" he said. \"I welcome the CJI (Criminal Justice Inspection) report because I think it's the first stage in rebuilding confidence in the office and the work that it does.\" He said work had been done to make improvements across a range of areas. \"We've recruited a significant number of new staff who have direct experience in major investigations, changed the ways we prioritise cases, introduced thorough investigative process which are subject to ongoing and systemic review and we've developed a consistent approach to communication for the families,\" he said. The ombudsman's office has been given \u00c2\u00a312m to complete more than 150 historical cases over the next six years. Dr Maguire admitted that the number of cases to examine was \"ambitious\". \"At the beginning of exercise we will be doing a lot of review work which collects investigative material,\" he said. \"Many of those cases, in some cases 20 or 30 complaints, can be clustered around a particular core issue and be dealt with on an ongoing basis. \"I think given those two reasons we're in a much better place to be able to look at these cases in a shorter time frame than has been before.\" However, the DUP's Paul Givan raised concerns about the re-opening of historical investigations. He said it had \"the potential to once again damage confidence in the ombudsman's office\". \"The DUP has consistently argued the police ombudsman should solely focus upon dealing with present day complaints into the PSNI and de-couple it from historical investigations which has marred this office in controversy from its inception,\" he said. \"As a result of this decision the ombudsman office will become the subject of intense political scrutiny and debate that will only serve to distract from the important oversight role it has for effectively dealing with modern day policing issues. \"",

The Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said the impact on patients had been minimal as the units were underused at night. Staff from the units have been moved to the Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, in Cramlington, which opened in 2015, to deal with a \"very high demand\" in day-time admissions. A spokesman said it would be \"inappropriate\" to deploy staff back to the urgent care centres overnight at the current time. He added: \"This is to ensure best use of precious staffing resources to deliver patient care where it is needed most.\" The trust said since opening the Northumbria hospital in June 2015, activity overnight at the urgent care centres had been \"minimal\" with, on average, less than 10 overnight attendances a day across all three centres. The spokesman added: \"We'd like to assure residents that this decision to temporarily extend the current arrangements at our urgent care centres has not been taken lightly. \"It was entirely correct for us to put in place the interim changes in the wake of services being extremely busy across the NHS. They have helped us successfully meet the high demand we continue to see, even now during the summer. \"As a result, it would simply not be the best use of our staff's time and expertise to deploy them back now.\"",

Dylan Marcus Edwards, 50, from Llanrwst in Conwy county, admitted causing suffering to Cali the cat which was put in a bag and hit with a piece of wood. Llandudno Magistrates' Court heard the cat defecated in the Royal Oak Hotel kitchen in Betws-y-Coed in December. Edwards was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for two years. Tudur Owen, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the cat had also bitten and scratched other members of staff. Colleagues had penned the cat under a fridge using chopping boards. Edwards and a colleague entered the kitchen saying \"we're going to have to kill the cat\" and came out with the animal inside a black bag, carrying a piece of wood and saying \"we'll have to put it out of its misery\". The court heard the pair were challenged by another colleague but Edwards was concerned the cat would return if they chased it away and said to her: \"We don't have a choice.\" There had been a furious local backlash following the cat's death and an online petition calling for those responsible to be prosecuted attracted more than 35,700 supporters. Melissa Griffiths, defending, said Edwards had been dismissed from his job after 32 years working at the hotel. \"He's been vilified since and has become a hermit in his own home, afraid to go out because of the strength of feeling against him,\" said Ms Griffiths. \"He's been verbally abused and refused service in his local village. He wrongly believed the cat was not a protected animal because it was feral.\" Edwards was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and pay \u00c2\u00a3865 costs. The court also heard the case against another 36-year-old man had been dropped. Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Phil Lewis said: \"The cat was put in a black bag and hit with a piece of wood. To me it's a heinous act. This was premeditated, pre-planned.\"",

    "source": "Sports minister Vitaly Mutko claims the country has done everything asked of it to meet IAAF anti-doping standards after being suspended last November. Athletics' governing body says Russia has made \"considerable progress\" but there is \"significant work to be done\". Russia will find out in May if it can send athletes to the Olympic Games. Mutko told Reuters: \"You say we should elect new leadership for the athletics federation - OK, we've done that. \"You should not elect anyone to be the leader who has done this or that - OK, we did that. \"There are no criteria. What should Russian athletics do? Dance on the table? Sing a song?\" Media playback is not supported on this device. Mutko's comments came after a taskforce set up by the International Association of Athletics Federations revealed its findings at a meeting in Monaco on Friday. Russia's athletics federation was suspended by the sport's world governing body in November after being accused of \"state-sponsored\" doping. IAAF president Lord Coe revealed five other nations - Ethiopia, Morocco, Ukraine, Kenya and Belarus - are also under scrutiny. He told BBC Sport: \"We want to return trust to our sport, this is not just a Russian issue. We have to be on the front foot, we need to be proactive about these things. \"I'm here to be judged on how many athletes I can get from safe secure systems into free, fair and open competition. And that has to be the sole arbiter.\" On the five other nations that are having their doping systems closely monitored, he said: \"Ethiopia and Morocco, as a matter of urgency, both need to implement adequate and robust testing in and out of competition. \"Kenya, Ukraine and Belarus have been put on a monitoring list for 2016 to strengthen their anti-doping regimes and make sure their journey to compliance is completed by the end of the year. \"There are no immediate sanctions. It is just a wake-up call. Sanctions will only be considered if they don't comply with requirements.\" The double Olympic champion also confirmed that a final decision on whether a Russian athletics team would compete in Rio would be made at the next IAAF council meeting, which will be convened for that specific purpose in May. Russia was suspended following the publication of an independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) report that examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in its athletics. It must demonstrate it meets Wada and IAAF rules before being readmitted into the sport and, potentially, allowed to compete in the Rio Olympics. The suspended Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) must also be able to operate without interference, following claims the country's security services were involved in the doping programme. Rune Andersen, a former director of Wada, leads the five-strong IAAF taskforce which is examining Russia's anti-doping procedures. \"Russian authorities have made significant progress to meeting many of the verification criteria established by the IAAF, including changing president and council,\" Andersen said. \"The view of the taskforce is there is significant work still to be done to satisfy the reinstatement conditions - it's a big job and they're just at the beginning of this.\" In an open letter, Beckie Scott, chair of the committee that represents athletes at Wada, wrote: \"There needs to be further investigation into other sports in Russia, and other countries identified in the report. \"The response to date - to such an evidence-based, incriminating report - has been unsatisfactory, and we renew our call for Wada to extend the mandate of the independent commission to sports in Russia other than athletics, as well as other countries named in the report. \"Wada states clearly that it supports clean athletes and at the moment, clean athletes are disappointed with the lack of action that has been taken.\"",

    "source": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\" But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense. The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it. He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister. When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura. The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio. Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters. But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign. Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq. The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair. He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\". Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\". The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire. The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%. Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers. Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson. He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas. Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers. In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe. His latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.",

Tens of thousands of security forces are deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir to fight the militancy which began in the late 1980s. AFSPA - the Armed Forces Special Powers Act - allows troops to shoot to kill suspected militants or arrest them without a warrant. Amnesty says these sweeping powers have led to a cycle of impunity for human rights violations in the troubled region. The report says not a single member of the armed forces has been tried in a civilian court for violating human rights in Kashmir. \"This lack of accountability has in turn facilitated other serious abuses,\" says Minar Pimple, the group's senior director of global operations. \"By not addressing human rights violations committed by security force personnel in the name of national security, India has not only failed to uphold its international obligations, but has also failed its own constitution,\" she added.

    "source": "Files were found after the attacks on a computer dumped in a rubbish bin, a well-placed source confirmed. The computer also included a final message from one of the airport bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui. Belgian authorities have identified all 32 victims who died on 22 March. Seventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care. The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack. The computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode. In his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore. Copies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US. Brussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed. A temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity,. Chief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt \"from the air conditioning to the check-in desks\". Several airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing \u20ac5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport. In a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough. They complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's \"open infrastructure\" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.",

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. \"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. \"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\" The Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. \"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. \"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. \"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists. \"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\" In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. \"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. \"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. \"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\" Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\" Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. \"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. \"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says. \"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. \"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says. ___________.

    "source": "These are external links and will open in a new window. The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the \"Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's \"Climate Brexit\" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends. Follow Barbara on Twitter.",

He then left the house, having locked both front and rear doors and some of the windows. The trial heard that Mr Ridley, whose address was given as HMP Inverness, was detained by police later that night at Cameron Avenue, Mallaig.

They are calling for action by the Scottish and UK governments to protect the industry and its jobs. About 400 marchers set off at 11:00 from the Dalzell works, heading to Ravenscraig for a rally. Up to 270 jobs could be lost after Tata Steel announced plans to mothball the plants  along with 900 posts at the firm's facility in Scunthorpe. A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. The company blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: \"We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. \"The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. \"The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved.\" The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: \"The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. \"We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. We don't want consolation measures such as retraining for other jobs that don't exist. There are other options that will protect the industry and its jobs. \"I believe Scottish steel can have a future, and we must consider all the options to achieve that, including public ownership, which doesn't rely on Westminster anymore.\"",

Clergy representatives said they were unable to comment on the claims published in the Guardian as they formed part of an active investigation. The priest said all five men were aware of his claims he had been repeatedly raped by a vicar when he was 16 in 1984, but none of them acted. He said he made the allegations verbally to the Right Reverend Peter Burrows, the Bishop of Doncaster; the Right Reverend Steven Croft, the former Bishop of Sheffield, and now Bishop of Oxford; and the Right Reverend Martyn Snow, a former Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham, and now the Bishop of Leicester, between July 2012 and February 2013. The Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the Right Reverend Glyn Webster, the Bishop of Beverley, were also made aware when they were copied in to a letter sent to the Rt Rev Croft in June 2013, he said. His lawyer, David Greenwood, of Switalskis Solicitors, said the priest finally spoke up after a safeguarding issue in his own parish \"triggered his memories\". \"He reached out for help to the Bishop of Doncaster but found that he got no help, no support and no response,\" he said. \"He continued to try to elicit a response from the senior people in his diocese but got nothing.\" Under the Church of England's clergy disciplinary measures a complaint must be made within one year of the alleged misconduct. An application for permission to make complaints out of time has been lodged and is being considered by the church. Mr Greenwood said a complaint had also been made to West Yorkshire Police and the details of the alleged misconduct passed to the Goddard Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. A spokesperson for the archbishop said he had only been sent a copy of the letter and the original recipient of the letter had \"a duty to respond and not the archbishop\". A spokesperson for the bishops said that if the complaint went forward \"our bishops will make a full response to the various allegations made in due course\". A complaint has also been made by the priest against Roy Williamson, a former bishop of Bradford and now an honorary assistant bishop with the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, that he failed to act at the time of the abuse. A spokesperson for his diocese said: \"We cannot comment during a live investigation except to say that if approached by the authorities we will offer them every co-operation.\" West Yorkshire Police said it is investigating a report of a historical serious sexual offence said to have occurred in the Bradford area in the 1980s. A force representative said: \"A crime has been recorded and a 69-year-old man has been spoken to in connection with the inquiry.\"",

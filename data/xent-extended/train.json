    "source": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign.\nHere, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs.\n1. The US should use waterboarding\nThis and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice.\n2. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\"\nMr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\".  BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn.\n3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\".\nHe's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\".\n4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11\nDonald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim.\n5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\".\nMr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks.\n6. Climate change is just \"weather\"\nWhile Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\"\n7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power\nMr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists.\n8. Illegal migrants should be deported\nTrump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation.\n9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\"\nHe says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees.\n10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\"\nHe has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him.\n11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone\nTrump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate.\n12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\"\nMr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class.\n13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues\nHe has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking.\n14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\"\nMr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers.\n15. He's worth $10bn\nBased on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn.\n16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul\nMr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans.\n17. Lobbyists should be more restricted\nMr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\n18. He is a \"really nice guy\"\nIn Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post.\n19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman\nA video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\"\n20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals\nHe has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\".\n21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\"\nWhy? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance.\n22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions\nOr should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead.\n23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\"\nHe called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him.\n24. The federal minimum wage should be raised\nWorkers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",

    "source": "I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation.\nHe is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web.\nTo some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet.\nTo others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted.\nDingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue.\nDingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\nThe Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\n\"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\"\nIn layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor].\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties.\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in.\nIn 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month.\n\"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\n\"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\"\nThe ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online.\nBut given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\n\"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says.\n___________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370",

VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%.\nWithin a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%.\nBy Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor\nWith money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed.\nRestrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s.\nAnd, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window.\nBuilding societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete.\nThe Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years.\nMrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988.\nThe new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired.\nThe promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions.\nCompensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn.\nMore successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break.\nTo complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa.\nThe idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away.\nBy John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News\nFew senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement.\nShe was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike.\nThe Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job.\nSecret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day.\nIn 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million.\nThe miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police.\nIn the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever.\nUnions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions.\nOne of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged.\nBy Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News\nA policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics.\nThe recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership.\nBy the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later.\nThis led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK.\nOne of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986.\nThe promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices.\nAnyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid.\nPrivatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing.\nIt also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies.\nYet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s.\nIn 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010.\nBy Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News\nThe impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK.\nThe so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face.\nBig Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading.\nIt also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.)\nBefore Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor.\nPrice competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm.\nAt best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping.\nBig Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops.\nThis, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses.\nBig Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares.\nBut while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\"\nThe Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport.\n\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty.\n\"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\"\nFleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne.\n\"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said.\n\"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

The pot's disappearing.\"\nFellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care.\n\"It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me,\" she says, \"There are a lot of us to be looked after.\"\nThe fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society.\nThe average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%.\nTax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%.\nAnother Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again.\n\"It's worrying,\" she says. \"I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more.\"\nSome rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer.\nFirst Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%.\nAnna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending.\n\"The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market,\" she explains, \"They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact.\"\nA spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years.\n\"While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear.\"\nThe looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again.\nBehind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\", given the precarious economic situation across the world.",

Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components.\nThis digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused.\n\"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\"\nBut her search turned up nothing. This was new.\nOnce she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said.\nBecause they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites.\nYet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled.\n\"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\".\nDr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away.\n\"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\"\nBeyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\"\nAs well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties.\n\"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\"",

    "source": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.\nPrime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\"\nBut now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.\nThe big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.\nHe has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.\nWhen he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.\nThe hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\nHe swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.\nGiven the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.\nBut crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.\nAlthough lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.\nIn 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.\nThe following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.\nHe created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\".\nLater he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\".\nThe London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.\nThe son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.\nAt Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.\nIn his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.\nHis decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.\nDays after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.\nAlthough suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.\nHe was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.\nMr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.\nIn 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.\nMr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.\nHis latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.",

    "source": "The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.\nIt also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry.\nOn Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction.\nThe decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \"ironclad information\" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \"pushed hard\" for its passage.\nA US state department spokesman said the accusation was \"just not true\", but he hoped the resolution would \"serve as a wake-up call\" for Israel.\nMore than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nThe Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\nIsrael rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.\nMr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.\nThe Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.\nBut on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.\nMr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.\n\"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said.\n\"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\"\nMr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January.\n\"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

    "source": "Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember.\nExperiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination.\nThe research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology.\nBut a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild.\nAnd another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids.\nThe government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals.\nFalling numbers\nHoney bees around the world are facing an uncertain future.\nThey have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet.\nNow researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline.\nTo investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee.\nNeonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States.\nWork carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity.\nDr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more.  The same effects occur when we used organophosphates.\n\"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\"\nAnother series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees.\nThe researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food.\nDr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\"\n'No threat'\nShe said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals.\nShe explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die.\n\"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\"\nThe European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators.\nBut 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed.\nIan Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\"\nHe said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\".\nDr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field.\n\"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained.\n\"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran.\nSpeaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as \"an indefensible verdict\" and warned Pakistan to \"consider the consequences\".\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do \"whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice\".\nOn Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death.\nPakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to \"plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan\".\nHe has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution.\nThe nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.\nIn November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India.\nIt later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.\nBut executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying.\nSarabjit Singh, an Indian man sentenced to death for spying in 1991, died in prison in 2013 while on death row after an attack by other prisoners.",

He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show.\nShould he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012.\nNo batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket.\nAnderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003.\nThe 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007.\n\"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson.\n\"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhile they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes.\nRoot scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals.\n\"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said.\n\"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good.\n\"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\"\nRoot has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended.\nHe was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year.\nAll-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood.\n\"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show.\n\"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\"\nFast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness.\n\"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\"\nWicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate.\nHowever, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series.\nEx-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting.\n\"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said.\nHowever, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries.\nSmith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations.\n\"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander.\n\"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one.\n\"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\"\nEngland and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy.\nThe pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14.\n\"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme.\n\"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him.\n\"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\"\nIMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017.\nOne of the footballing hotbeds in the country is Pune, a city in the west of the country with a three million-plus population.\n\"Sport, including football, is tremendously popular among the youth of our city today,\" says Vishwajeet Kadam,  president of Pune District Football Association.\n\"We don't only focus on the skills development of players. We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\"\nPune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city.\n\"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam.\n\"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market.\n\"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\"\nOne club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children.\nMario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days.\n\"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support.\n\"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\"\nBusiness bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football.\nRajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise.\n\"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure.\n\"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football.\n\"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\"\nIMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF.\n\"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack.\nMr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\".\nHe adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from an??? organisation standpoint.\n\"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work.\n\"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand. Football needs to succeed. It needs a plan. We are are not there yet.\n\"But the long term view we have is that this will be lucrative.\"\nMeanwhile, uncertainty remains about the future of the proposed, but currently delayed, Premier Soccer League (PLS) in West Bengal.\nThe PLS was intended as a state league for older European players - such as Robert Pires and Fabio Cannavaro. It attracted publicity around the world, particularly in the UK.\nMr Slack said he understood the premise of the league as, he says, India is a country that is \"star driven\".\nBut he said there was a pressing need to boost the status of the current Indian national soccer league.\n\"We are in dialogue with I-League about how to make the league more competitive and attractive,\" he says.\n\"There are no easy solutions there. We completely understand that the clubs need to get more out of it.\"",

    "source": "But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined.\nThe US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it.\nAs news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration.\nBut there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out.\nThe Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football.\nThis is not just about sport of course.\nThe Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call \"internationalisation\" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa.\nThe issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote.\nThis time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote.\n\"I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,\" he told me. \"It is our right.\"\nThe Palestinians believe their case is strong.\nThey complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games.\nThe point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank.\nIt's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained.

    "source": "But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined.\nThe US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it.\nAs news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration.\nBut there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out.\nThe Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football.\nThis is not just about sport of course.\nThe Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call \"internationalisation\" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa.\nThe issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote.\nThis time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote.\n\"I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,\" he told me. \"It is our right.\"\nThe Palestinians believe their case is strong.\nThey complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games.\nThe point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank.\nIt's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained. The match was abandoned.\nPalestinian territory is divided into two parts - Gaza and the West Bank.

    "source": "Files were found after the attacks on a computer dumped in a rubbish bin, a well-placed source confirmed.\nThe computer also included a final message from one of the airport bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui.\nBelgian authorities have identified all 32 victims who died on 22 March.\nSeventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care.\nThe first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday.\nThe discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek.\nThe three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found.\nQuoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street.\nIt is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves.\nA spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable.\nThe chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack.\nThe computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode.\nIn his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore.\nCopies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US.\nBrussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed.\nA temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity,\nChief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt \"from the air conditioning to the check-in desks\".\nSeveral airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing \u20ac5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport.\nIn a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough.\nThey complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's \"open infrastructure\" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.",

    "source": "The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote.\nMr Santos said he dedicated the award to \"all the victims of the conflict\", and the Farc leader congratulated him.\nAbout 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia.\nThe award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord.\nThe head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's \"resolute efforts\" to end the conflict.\n\"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process,\" Kaci Kullman Five added.\nSources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency\nMr Santos said on Twitter: \"This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace.\"\nThe peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October.\nThe committee acknowledged the result, saying: \"What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\"\nIt also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge.\nAlso on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: \"I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible.\"\nEarlier, he had written: \"The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets.\"\nThis was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement.\nBut it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW.\nWhy, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected?\nBut the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal.\nCritics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels.\nUnder the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict.\nThose who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons.\nThe Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections.\nDespite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels.\nGovernment negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders.\nKaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as \"encouragement\" to the rebels.\n\"Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties.\n\"The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.''\n1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party\n2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing.\nUsers can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK.\nThere is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video.\nThe spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\"\nHowever, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\".\n\"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy.\n\"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".\nSue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\".\nShe said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\".\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\"\n\"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

    "source": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte.\nAcross the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies.\n\"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland.\nThe project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme.\nMcClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded.\nAlternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now.\nAt the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year.\nGauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators.\n\"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added.\n\"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time.\n\"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football.\n\"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\"\nThe other important gauge of success is academic achievement.\nExam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis.\n\"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland.\n\"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset.\n\"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\"\nIndeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\".\nBut it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",

    "source": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte.\nAcross the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies.\n\"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland.\nThe project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme.\nMcClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded.\nAlternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now.\nAt the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year.\nGauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators.\n\"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added.\n\"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time.\n\"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football.\n\"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\"\nThe other important gauge of success is academic achievement.\nExam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis.\n\"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland.\n\"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset.\n\"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\"\nIndeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\".\nBut it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",

    "source": "In a series of Twitter posts addressed directly to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro also called him a \"petty dictator\".\nMr Maduro accused the OAS chief earlier this week of being a CIA agent and a traitor himself.\nThe Venezuelan president has blamed his country's economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co-ordinated from the US.\nDuring a three-hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified his declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA.\nHe then told journalists: \"Almagro, just give up. He has been a traitor for a long time... At some point I will tell his story, I know his secrets. The Americans, the CIA, have played a master move using Almagro as their agent.\"\nMr Almagro, who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay, had already clashed with Mr Maduro last year after he called him \"rubbish\".\nMr Almagro had responded on that occasion with an eight-page open letter, saying he would be \"rubbish\" if he ignored the plight of the Venezuelan people.\nHis Twitter posts this week were both more concise and more direct.\nLinking to his open letter to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro said: @NicolasMaduro I'm not a traitor either to my ideas or my principles BUT YOU ARE A TRAITOR to your people.\nIn a series of 12 tweets, he also told the Venezuelan president that \"you will NEVER be able to undo so much suffering, intimidation, misery and anguish you've created for your people\".\nHe also said Mr Maduro would \"NEVER be able to bring back to life the children who've died because of lack of medicine\".\nVenezuelan doctors say a shortage of essential medicine has reached a crisis point.\nMr Almagro also urged Mr Maduro to allow a recall referendum to go ahead.\nOpposition politicians have handed in a petition with 1.85 million signatures to the electoral authorities requesting a referendum be held to recall Mr Maduro from office.\nBut Mr Maduro's deputy, Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were \"fraudulent\".\nMr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro \"another petty dictator\".\nWhile President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro's tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did.\nShe wrote, \"Mr Almagro, every time you make a statement you express your hatred against Venezuela and its legitimate authorities. You are part of the imperialist detritus.\"\n\"You only repeat the scripted words which your imperialist masters dictate to you\".\n\"You will never give orders to Venezuela!\"\nThe former president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, has also commented on the row between Mr Almagro, who served as Mr Mujica's foreign minister, and President Maduro.\nAsked what he made of the bitter exchange, he said using a popular Spanish saying that Mr Maduro was \"crazy as a goat\".\n\"They're all crazy in Venezuela, they call each other all sorts of things but they're not going to fix anything this way.\"\nWhile Mr Mujica is known for his direct and outspoken manner his words are damaging to Mr Maduro, who has always praised the former left-wing president as a \"comrade\".",

It's a deliberate insult,\" he said.\n\"Its organisers should think carefully about the effect this could have on bereaved families here, families still reeling from the crimes of the past, not to mention the ordinary citizens of this city.\"\nThirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972, and a 14th victim died later, after troops opened fire on a civil rights march.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Bloody Sunday Trust, Minty Thompson said holding the march in Derry was a \"deliberately provocative act\".\n\"This city has clearly been chosen because it was the scene of one of the most horrific acts of state violence in our history, Bloody Sunday, and because soldiers who were involved in that event, who shot down innocent and unarmed people on our streets, are at long last being investigated for their actions,\" he said.\nThe Northern Ireland branch of the Veterans for Justice UK group was established in December 2015.\nAnto Wickham, who is organising the Derry march, said their aims were to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing \"false prosecutions\".\n\"If soldiers break the law then they face the rigours of the law and rightly so, and it's the same as it should be for any other member of the community,\" he said.\n\"But where's the investigation into my colleagues and friends who were murdered? It just seems to be forgotten about.\"\nThe former Royal Irish Regiment soldier added the marches were planned in 2016 as part of a larger campaign to put pressure on the government.\nMr Wickham said he was \"upset\" by suggestions the march was planned to raise tensions in the city.\n\"I understand the families and the victims are still really hurt and they want prosecutions.\n\"If that's the case, and there is evidence, then you have to face the rigours of the law but that should also be the same with the IRA.\"\nThe prosecution of those involved in killings is a major stumbling block in efforts to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles.\nLast month, the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland said critics who accused him of treating former soldiers unfairly had insulted him and his office.\nBarra McGrory QC said he was mystified by claims he did not act impartially when he brought charges against a small number of ex-soldiers.\nMeanwhile, lawyers representing former soldiers facing prosecution have said they are being 'unfairly treated'.",

    "source": "Tory MP David Davis said news of the proposed in-work benefits ban could encourage workers to head to the UK.\nSir Eric Pickles, a Eurosceptic who supports Mr Cameron's reform proposals, said action had to be taken to prevent a \"new influx\" of migrants.\nThe ban has to be agreed by all EU nations at a summit on 18 February.\nIt will be graduated, so that the longer migrant workers stay in the UK, the more in-work benefits, such as tax credits, they will be entitled to, in order to top-up their wages.\nEU referendum: PM faces grassroots anger over EU vote\nMr Cameron says the move will \"make a difference\" to high levels of immigration by reducing a \"pull factor\".\nBut it will have to be agreed by member states, as part of a wider package of reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, and will only apply for a temporary period as an \"emergency brake\".\nIf Mr Cameron can get a deal on his reform package in two weeks' time at the Brussels summit he is expected to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU in June.\nDavid Davis, a former Tory leadership contender and leading Eurosceptic, said eastern European newspapers had carried numerous stories about the plan to terminate in-work benefits for the first four years after a migrant's arrival in the UK.\nAt the same time, he said, Brussels has suggested the scheme could take 12 months to implement.\n\"Under such circumstances the incentive for anybody wishing to come to live in the UK will be to come as quickly as possible to beat the deadline when any such restrictions come into effect,\" he said.\n\"Accordingly we are likely to see a surge in migrants in the next 12 months.\"\nMr Cameron has suggested the \"emergency brake\" could come into effect within three months of the UK applying for it.\nEric Pickles defended Mr Cameron's reform deal, on the BBC's Sunday Politics, saying: \"What we need to be clear is, we're not trying to prevent people moving inside the European Union.\"\nThe reforms were instead aimed at preventing people gaining \"something for nothing\" by claiming UK benefits before contributing anything in tax.\nBut Sir Eric. a Conservative former cabinet minister, said action was needed to prevent a surge of migrants: \"Clearly as part of the negotiations we have to ensure that that doesn't happen.\"\nMeanwhile, speculation is continuing about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU.\nThe Mail on Sunday said Boris Johnson, who has previously said Britain could prosper outside the EU and suggested Mr Cameron's deal needed more work, has told a fellow Tory MP he had \"never been an 'outer'\".\nBernard Jenkin, a leading member of Vote Leave, told the newspaper: \"He is genuinely torn but I hope he will change his mind because he is one of the few who understands that if we stay in, Britain will be in a weaker position than ever before.\"\nOther potential Tory \"outers\" include Justice Secretary Michael Gove and Employment Minister Priti Patel, who have said they will make their position clear when they have seen the final deal.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who according to the Mail on Sunday has described the deal to friends as a \"load of rubbish\" which would be challenged in the European courts, is also refusing to comment publicly until the deal is finalised.\nUKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it \"would be wonderful\" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it would welcome anyone who wants to join it.\nHe refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying they had fundamental differences.\nHe said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on \"identity and immigration,\" while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an \"optimistic, upbeat internationalist message\".\nA third group, Grassroots Out (GO), which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign.\nOne of its founders, Peter Bone, told the Sunday Politics there were 42 different Eurosceptic groups working together under the cross-party GO \"umbrella,\" and it was possible for them all to to operate as \"one happy family\".",

    "source": "The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe.\nBritain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally.\nThis Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least.\nSince the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration.\nIts public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: \"Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.\"\nThis is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda.\nThe prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them.\nIn contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a \"whinge-o-rama\".\nSome British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation.\nShe was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was \"normal\" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US.\nAs if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag.\nSo on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting.\nAnd all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table.\nWhat happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group?\nThis was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU.\nThis is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe.\nShe has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington.\nThe UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office.\nMr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as \"probably... my closest international partner these eight years\".\nIn vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: \"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.\"\nSo the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established.\nOfficials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January.\nThe Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump.\nBut at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries.\nThe former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. \"For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,\" he said.\nIn the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions.\nThe government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process.\nFalling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.",

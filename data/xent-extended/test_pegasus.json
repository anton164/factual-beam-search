    "source": "Sir Tim Hunt, who is a Royal Society fellow, reportedly told a conference in South Korea women in labs \"cry\" when you criticise them and \"fall in love\" with their male counterparts.\nHe told the BBC he \"did mean\" the remarks but was \"really sorry\".\nThe society said Sir Tim's comments did not reflect its own views.\nSir Tim, 72, who was awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2001 for his work on how cells divide, reportedly told the World Conference of Science Journalists: \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he was \"really sorry that I said what I said\", adding it was \"a very stupid thing to do in the presence of all those journalists\".\nThe British biochemist, who was knighted in 2006, said the remarks were \"intended as a light-hearted, ironic comment\" but had been \"interpreted deadly seriously by my audience\".\nHe went on to say he stood by some of the remarks.\n\"I did mean the part about having trouble with girls,\" he said. \"It is true that people - I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field.\n\"I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult.\n\"I'm really, really sorry I caused any offence, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually.\"\nOn his remarks about women crying, he said: \"It's terribly important that you can criticise people's ideas without criticising them and if they burst into tears, it means that you tend to hold back from getting at the absolute truth.\n\"Science is about nothing but getting at the truth and anything that gets in the way of that diminishes, in my experience, the science.\"\nConnie St Louis, a lecturer in science journalism at City University, was in the 100-strong audience in South Korea.\n\"Nobody was laughing, everybody was stony-faced,\" she told the BBC News Channel.\n\"The Korean female scientists who hosted us looked aghast and he just ploughed on for about five to seven minutes.\n\"It was just really shocking. It was culturally insensitive and it was very sexist. I just thought, 'Where in the world do you think you are that you can be making these kind of comments in 2015?'\"\nDr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London, added: \"I think it was clear he was trying to be funny. But people will interpret his comments as having a kernel of truth underneath. And as a Nobel laureate, I know he's a human being, but he does have some sort of responsibility as a role model and as an ambassador for the profession.\"\nImran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said Sir Tim's comments were \"careless\".\n\"Sadly, dealing with sexism and other forms of discrimination are a daily reality for many people, and I imagine it's hard to find Sir Tim's comments funny if you've been held back by systemic bias for years - whether those remarks were intended as a joke or not,\" he said.\nThe Royal Society, which promotes and supports scientific advances, said: \"Too many talented individuals do not fulfil their scientific potential because of issues such as gender and the society is committed to helping to put this right.\n\"Sir Tim Hunt was speaking as an individual and his reported comments in no way reflect the views of the Royal Society.\"",

    "source": "The sceptics insist that growth has been largely jobless and deepened inequality in an already hierarchical society.\nThe optimistic refute this gloomy thesis and believe that the rising tide has lifted all boats.\nAs an example, they point to the emergence of a small but growing class of Dalit (formerly known as untouchables, the lowest in India's wretched caste hierarchy) millionaires.\nSo much so that Dalit activists like Chandra Bhan Prasad like to call it  a \"golden period\" for Dalits where \"material markers are replacing social markers\".\nStudies have also shown that the wage gap between Dalits and other castes have narrowed and their standing has improved. There is even a Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nBut new research by Lakshmi Iyer, Tarun Khanna and Ashustosh Varshney paints a less rosy picture.\nDelving into the relationship between caste and entrepreneurship, the researchers have found that scheduled castes and tribes, the most disadvantaged groups in Hinduism's hierarchy, owned very little businesses despite a decade of sprightly economic growth and a long history of affirmative action.\nMining information thrown up by the 2005 economic census covering more than 42 million enterprises, they found schedule castes owned only 9.8% of all enterprises in India in 2005, well below their 16.4% share of the total population.\nThe scheduled tribes owned only 3.7% of non-farm enterprises despite being 7.7% of the population.\nHowever, ownership of business among OBC's - an acronym for Other Backward Castes or the \"middle castes\" who \"neither suffering the extreme social and economic discrimination of the Scheduled Castes, nor enjoying the social privileges of the upper castes\" - has grown.\nOBCs comprise 41% of India's people. Their members owned 43.5% of all enterprises in 2005, and accounted for 40% of non-farm employment.\nThis is a remarkable achievement considering that affirmative action for this group was widely introduced only in the 1990s.\nThe pattern of dismally low ownership of businesses among the most disadvantaged groups, the researchers found, is not specific to any one region or state in India.\nEven in states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra that were among the first to have social movements to end caste discrimination, ownership of enterprises is low.\nStates with high population of the disadvantaged groups also show that they are under-represented in ownership of businesses.\nThe researchers say there could be a host of reasons - caste discrimination itself (members of other castes refuse to work with the lowest castes), lack of knowledge, illiteracy, and problems with securing finance.\n\"All these factors,\" they say, \"can prevent scheduled castes from entering industries that have significant economies of scale.\"\nGrowth possibilities are limited by differences in the size of worker networks -  scheduled caste owners find it easier to work with scheduled caste workers.\nI asked Dr Varshney, who teaches at the US's Brown University, whether the findings really came as a surprise, given that deeper social changes in societies like India take a lot of time.\nHe said he wasn't.\n\"I should, however, add that the story of the rise of the Dalit millionaires is not small either. Though numerically insignificant, it is politically, economically and socially very significant,\" he told me.\nOver time, he believes, the rise of Dalits \"may well become comparable\" to the rise of Nadars - a southern caste - in Tamil Nadu.\nUntil about 150 years ago Nadars - mostly \"toddy tappers\" - were condemned to a near untouchable status. Today, they are a leading business community in the state and are found in all classes.\nI asked Dr Varshney whether increased representation in politics had anything to do with higher ownership of business for different caste groups? I cited the example of the increasingly influential OBC-led politics in the country.\n\"Whether that happens remains unclear. The correlation undoubtedly exists, but the causes are still to be sorted out,\" he said.\nI also wondered why decades of affirmative action and more than two decades of economic liberalisation hadn't still unleashed entrepreneurial energies among the most disadvantaged.\n\"Such transformations can take a long time,\" he said. \"The rise of the Nadars, for example, took nearly eight to 10 decades, depending on how one defines the rise.\"",

    "source": "Tour de France winner Wiggins became the most decorated Olympian in British history, with a total of seven medals.\nHe won the cycling time trial after Glover and Stanning rowed to victory in the women's pairs; all three were hailed by PM David Cameron.\nGB's Michael Jamieson later took the silver in the men's 200m breaststroke.\nTeam GB kept the nation waiting until day five of the Games for the first home gold medals; however, there are high hopes for further podium finishes in Thursday's cycling.\nAfter his victory, Wiggins, 32, cycled through cheering crowds gathered at Hampton Court, where he hugged his wife Catherine and his children Ben and Isabella.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Wiggins said that despite his success, he did not consider himself to be Britain's greatest ever Olympian.\nHe also said that, fresh from his victory in the Tour de France, he had been \"greedy\" and also intended to win Olympic gold. \"I felt I could do both,\" he said, adding that the crowd support on his Olympic time trial ride was \"incredible\".\nDavid Cameron described the successes in rowing and cycling as a \"golden moment for Britain\".\nMr Cameron said: \"I think it's already a great Olympics, already a great start but this is really going to put rocket boosters on it for the whole country. I'm very, very excited.\"\nMeanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive.\nPolice have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets.\nDet Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: \"If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't.\"\nIn other developments:\nBriton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people.\nWiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line.\n\"I screamed when he won.  It is a combination of delight and relief... We all think he is the greatest,\" she said.\nEarlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing.\nMr Johnson said an \"historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today\".\n\"It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB,\" he added.\nGlover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray.\nThey stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race.\nAfter crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal.\nSpeaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was \"absolutely delighted\".\nStanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year.\nHer commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: \"Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK.\n\"I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year.\"\nLt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had \"done a very special thing\".\n\"We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment,\" he told Stanning.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as \"fantastic\" and said the games were going \"beyond\" expectations.",

    "source": "Many favourites were simply wiped away: Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, even Eric Pickles. Was Boris Johnson their only consolation?\nIt was no better for female impersonators: while Nicola Sturgeon was a welcome new voice, the grim reality dawned: it would no longer be possible to put off doing Theresa May.\n\"My life flashed before me and Miliband wasn't in it,\" Rory Bremner told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour.\n\"I lost Galloway, which was a tragedy for impersonators everywhere,\" says Lewis Macleod, of Dead Ringers.\nPondering his other losses that night, he jokes: \"I suffered a heavy defeat and I didn't even get a severance package.\"\nPoliticians do not owe impressionists a living, of course, but their art has become such an established feature of British politics that it would be a shame if a dearth of strong characters on the green Commons benches was to kill it off.\nIt all began with Peter Cook in Beyond the Fringe. His befuddled take on Harold Macmillan, the patrician grouse moor Tory who told Britons they had \"never had it so good\", was seen as a thrilling challenge to the old, established order at the birth of the \"satire boom\" in the early 1960s. No one had dared to impersonate the prime minister before.\nMuch to Cook's annoyance, Macmillan sat in the stalls one evening chortling away as his own mannerisms and voice were mercilessly sent-up, prompting the satirist to depart from his script, saying, in Macmillan's pompous tones: \"There's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin spread all over my silly face\".\nHistory does not record whether this wiped the grin off Macmillan's face. But if Cook thought his barbs would stop politicians trying to get in on the joke, he had underestimated the thickness of their hide or their seemingly pathological desire to be seen as a good sport.\nSitting with a silly grin on your face, on a chat show sofa, as a comedian mimics your strange mannerisms is now a rite of passage for Britain's political leaders.\nIt was Mike Yarwood, with his affectionate but deadly accurate take-offs of characters like Ted Heath, with his heaving shoulders and toothy grin, and Denis Healey, all bushy eyebrows and bluff bonhomie, who brought political impressions to a mainstream television audience. He even furnished Healey with a catchphrase - \"silly Billy\" - which became associated with him in real life.\nYarwood also pioneered the trend for impersonating political journalists - who were (and still are) just as eccentric, or larger than life, as those they interrogate - with his wheezy take on the obstreperous Sir Robin Day.\nRory Bremner took up Yarwood's mantle in the 1990s, although his act owed more to the golden age of political satire than light entertainment. He even recruited two stalwarts of the 1960s scene, John Bird and John Fortune, to add extra bite to his send-ups of Tony Blair's government and the perceived inanity and spin of New Labour.\nThe one thing all of these impersonators have in common is that they had great material to work with.\nThe need to look good on television has steadily worn the rough edges off our political leaders. It is not media training - Gordon Brown had plenty of that, but was still a rich seam of vocal and facial tics for the nation's impressionists, more a by-product of the managerialism that has infected the upper reaches of public life.\nThe tide may be turning, however.\nThe public's rejection of smooth, identikit politicians - witness the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump - could yet herald a new golden age for impressionists.\n\"When Clinton was the president I think he had been impeached before I had mastered his voice,\" says Lewis Macleod, who has got in early with a Trump impersonation.\nHis Dead Ringers colleague Jan Ravens tells the Westminster Hour she is working on her Hilary Clinton, with her folksy, \"down home\" tones and attempts to come across as a regular \"gramma\".\nRory Bremner says his Jeremy Corbyn is a work in progress - his starting point is the ineffectual, well-meaning warder Barraclough, in classic prison sitcom Porridge.\nBut the veteran impressionist has developed a fondness for impersonating David Cameron, despite the prime minister's lack of any obvious vocal eccentricities.\nAnd if all fails there is always Boris, or the political broadcasters, to fall back on.",

I was born here,\" the eponymous Ken told BBC Radio London.\n\"Dad's still out the back cooking and mum is serving. West Ham is in the blood and it's been good to us.\n\"It will be a bit quieter but we'll survive. We'll carry on because we've got all our regulars that come in during the week.\"\nUp the road, Osman Mustafa of Queen's Fish Bar is less optimistic about his prospects.\n\"At least 25% of our business comes from West Ham,\" he said.\n\"I hope I can keep going.

Although both men claimed victory at the end, the verdict went with Sturm.\nMacklin insisted: \"I should be champion. I believe I was the better fighter, but it is not Felix's fault, he wasn't a judge.\"\nBut Sturm said: \"It wasn't a wrong decision, but it was close.\n\"It was not my most outstanding performance, but I have had a few clear shots and Matt worked hard. In my view, the decision was absolutely correct.\n\"We will definitely have a second fight, we have already agreed it.\"\nMeanwhile, Kell Brook kept his world title ambitions on course with a comfortable points victory over Lovemore N'Dou in his home city of Sheffield.\nBrook now has 24 wins and no defeats, although he was unable to extend a run of eight wins inside the distance against the wily veteran.",

Palau favours sustainable tourism, which along with foreign aid is the mainstay of its economy.\nPalau became independent in 1994, after being part of a United Nations trust territory administered by the US for 47 years.\nIt relies on financial aid from the US, provided under a Compact of Free Association which gives the US responsibility for Palau's defence and the right to maintain military bases there. Direct aid was set to wind up in 2009, but the US agreed to an additional package of $250 million in January 2010.\nTourism is low key, although growing in economic importance. Many visitors come from Taiwan, with which Palau has diplomatic ties. Taiwanese aid boosts the economy. The government is Palau's largest employer.\nMonoliths and other relics are reminders of an ancient culture that thrived on the islands, and despite Western trappings many Palauans identify strongly with their traditions and rites.\nPalau's recent history has been dominated by outside influences from Spain, Britain, Germany, Japan and the US. Palau saw some of the region's fiercest fighting in World War II.\nThere is concern that the low-lying islands could be badly affected by rising sea levels possibly due to climate change.\nPopulation 20,600\nArea 508 sq km (196 sq miles)\nMajor languages Palauan, English\nMajor religions Christianity, Modekngei (indigenous belief)\nLife expectancy 66 years (men), 72 years (women)\nCurrency US dollar\nPresident: Tommy Remengesau\nTommy Remengesau was sworn in for a fourth non-consecutive term as president in January 2017, after beating his brother-in-law Surangel Whipps Jr in a closely fought election.\nHe described the 2016 election race as one of the toughest ever on both a political and personal level.\nHe has said that his vision for Palau is to achieve a sustainable future for the country by balancing growth, development and the protection of the Palau's environmental and cultural assets.\nThe law provides for a free press, and there are no reports of official curbs on internet access.\nThe senate has twice tried to ban foreign ownership of media.

They say they want more answers and will not give up looking for them.\nSo how can Mexico move on?\nLast week Lourdes Caballero Sanchez took to the streets of the capital with thousands of other Mexicans to call for justice.\nIt was a personal journey for her. Lourdes's 21-year-old brother Israel is one of the missing.\nHer belief that she will find him is unwavering.\n\"I have an intuition that he's still alive.

    "source": "They were last seen alive during a protest in the town of Iguala.\nPolice fired on them and rounded them up, eventually handing them over to members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, who are widely thought to have killed them.\nBut the students' families refuse to believe they are dead. They say they want more answers and will not give up looking for them.\nSo how can Mexico move on?\nLast week Lourdes Caballero Sanchez took to the streets of the capital with thousands of other Mexicans to call for justice.\nIt was a personal journey for her. Lourdes's 21-year-old brother Israel is one of the missing.\nHer belief that she will find him is unwavering.\n\"I have an intuition that he's still alive. That's why we are here, asking [President] Pena Nieto to give us back our boys,\" she told me.\n\"As a sister, I'm desperate. I miss him, I want to see him. I feel so powerless to not be able to do anything for him.\"\nBut less than 24 hours later, Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam delivered a blow.\nHe declared that the students were dead.\nHis team, he said, had interviewed 99 people including members of the criminal gang that he alleges murdered the students.\nBased on 386 declarations from interviewees, 16 police raids and two reconstructions, the conclusion was that the students were killed by the gang and their bodies burned at a rubbish dump.\nThe students' families angrily rejected this scenario.\nAt a press conference held later in the day, one mother stood up and claimed that her son was not missing, he was being held by the government.\nAccusations that the government needs to be called to account have been flying at the same time that the authorities have been trying to draw this questioning to a close.\nThe prosecutor reassured the families the case would not be shut yet, but even President Enrique Pena Nieto has said Mexico needs to move on.\nFor many though, that is not an option.\n\"I can understand the political logic of trying to put this behind the country, but I don't think there are the objective conditions for the country to turn the page,\" says independent security analyst Alejandro Hope.\n\"The government has provided a narrative of what happened but hasn't yet provided an explanation. In the absence of a detailed version of why, this case will not be closed.\"\nThe war on drugs has taken a brutal toll on Mexico in the past decade.\nMore than 100,000 people have been killed and the latest official figures put the number of missing at 23,271.\nThis week, some of the parents of the missing students travelled to Geneva to appeal for help from the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances.\nMexico's National Human Rights Commission also published a report ahead of the visit.\nCommission President Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez criticised the impunity in Mexican society, which he believes dates back to the 1970s and 1980s: decades when the government and left-wing student groups clashed with deadly results.\nHe gave several recommendations to be discussed at the UN's sessions, one of which was a more systematic database of the missing to understand the true extent of the problem.\nOne of the big concerns among human rights groups is that although many of the suspects arrested have been charged with kidnapping and murder, none have been charged with the crime of enforced disappearance.\n\"It reflects that the Mexican government is reluctant to recognise that in Mexico enforced disappearances occur,\" says Denise Gonzalez, of the Miguel Agustin ProJuarez Human Rights Centre.\n\"They are trying to water down their responsibilities. They are reluctant to recognise that state officials have engaged in enforced disappearances in Mexico.\"\nIn a country used to the high number of dead in the drug war, this case of the Ayotzinapa students has stood out.\nThe feeling, say experts, is that these young men should not be viewed as collateral in a narco-war.\nIt has forced people to push for change.\n\"The majority of Mexicans are now empowered and feel a personal responsibility to change things in the country,\" says John M Ackerman, a law professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University.\n\"This is an invaluable achievement since it implies an historic break with the learned pessimism and passivity encouraged daily on the principal television and radio networks in Mexico.\"\nTheir disappearance has forced the government to make changes, too.\nIn November, President Pena Nieto announced plans to put all local police units under federal control and allow Congress to dissolve local governments infiltrated by drugs gangs.\nBut with mid-term elections later this year, there are question marks as to whether these sweeping announcements will all get voted in.\n\"It was a watershed moment for Mexican society, maybe,\" says Alejandro Hope. \"But a watershed moment for government policy? I don't think so.\"\nDespite the feeling of stalemate among many, the investigation is not over yet.\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) signed an agreement in November with the Mexican government and representatives of the disappeared students to look into the events of Ayotzinapa.\nThey will be holding their first meeting later this month.\nThere are still many questions surrounding the students' disappearance.\nThe hope is that perhaps the IACHR will provide some answers to try and prevent another Ayotzinapa from ever happening again.",

    "source": "We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia.\nWhat we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin.\nWe travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages.\nWhat we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people.\nWe met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast.\nLet's call him Kamrul Rahman.\nHe appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up.\nAs the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked.\nHe said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them.\nIt seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost.\nHe said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about \u00c2\u00a31,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand.\nI was amazed. \"So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?\" I asked.\n\"Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger\", he told me, without any sign of emotion.\n\"If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour.\"\nWe spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh.\nThey all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made.\nWhat this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party.\nThe so-called \"ransoms\" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey.\nTake a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys.\nThey are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp.\nStina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into.\nIf you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers.\nThe migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like.\nMeanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid.\nThe model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier.\nIt seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand.\nBut other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty.\nWe were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (\u00c2\u00a3260/$400) back to his family each month.\nBut many, many migrants don't make it.\nWithin minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters).\nSome said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family.\nAccording to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia.\nMany die before they even reach the camps, he told me.\n\"Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food.\n\"All people have to die\", he said, \"that is fate.\"",

    "source": "Due to travel to Cardiff to pose for photos and answer questions at a Heineken Cup press launch, Saracens told him he had to be at an \"important squad meeting\" in Munich the same day.\nHe complied. Perhaps unsurprisingly considering the \"important squad meeting\" was a day-trip to the city's Oktoberfest beer festival.\nWith the skipper alongside them, the first-team squad made so merry that one of their number failed to make the midnight flight home.\nEuropean rugby officials were not amused, however. They fined Saracens \u00a34,250 for instructing Borthwick to snub Heineken Cup matters for the business of sinking steins.\nWe're trying to be a little bit different, which will always raise eyebrows. Maybe others should look at what we're doing\nSaracens chief executive Edward Griffiths was unapologetic, and Bavaria drinking music pumped out of the speakers before the team's win over Leicester the following weekend.\n\"We're trying to be a little bit different, which will always raise eyebrows,\" he said. \"Maybe others should look at what we're doing.\"\nThis was the autumn of 2010 and Griffiths had been in his job a little over 18 months, having arrived, along with South African director of rugby Brendan Venter, in a series of sweeping changes.\nThe suggestion that Saracens should be the template for others did not seem justified by the north London's club history.\nTrue, they had been denied their first Premiership title the previous season only by a dramatic late Dan Hipkiss try. But for many years Sarries had been a middling club, rarely competitive when the going got tough and rarely threatening to win anything.\nEight months after the Oktoberfest jaunt, they won their first Premiership title.\nThree years further on and they were within two games of a Heineken Cup and Premiership double, facing Toulon and Northampton on successive Saturdays.\nDefeat by the French side on Saturday denied them the first of those, but success in the second remains within their grasp.\nBefore taking up his role with Saracens, Edward Griffiths was chief executive of the South African Rugby Union. He has been credited with ensuring that the 1995 World Cup-winning Springboks side learned all the verses of the new national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, and coming up with the slogan 'one team, one country'.\nThe 'cult of Saracens' - as some have dubbed their way of doing things - is certainly taken seriously now with Griffiths as its charismatic, unorthodox high priest.\nWhile most sports administrators are usually caught between the demands of the balance sheet and the score sheet, he describes himself as merely \"interested\" in the outcome of both finals. And even that sounds like a stretch.\n\"Too much of sport operates under the tyranny of the result,\" Griffiths tells BBC Sport.\n\"The core principle at Saracens is that we gather talented people together, treat them unbelievably well and in return they try unbelievable hard. That is it.\n\"Everything else - winning or losing matches, winning or losing Cups - are just outcomes. They are not the primary aim.\n\"We exist to have a positive impact on as many people as possible.\"\nIt sounds like the philosophy of a smoothie company or perhaps an idealistic Silicon Valley start-up - not the hard-nosed, shape-up-or-ship-out approach of most high-level sport.\nBut it works and Saracens pay much more than lip service to the concept of treating their staff \"unbelievably well\".\nTheir regular foreign jaunts are an obvious part of the process.\nSince 2010 the players have sunned themselves in the Italian resort of Rimini, hung out in Miami, hit the ski slopes in Switzerland and returned to Munich for a longer stay at Oktoberfest - all while their rivals are slogging it out on the training field.\nOne trip involved the players separating into groups to make their way from their Hertfordshire base to a rendezvous in Barcelona by whatever means they chose. On another, they climbed Cape Town's Table Mountain together.\nThis year they went to New York, taking in an ice hockey match at Madison Square Gardens.\nWhile the destinations are exotic, what goes on upon arrival is old-fashioned: no team-building larks, no trust exercises, no flipcharts. Instead, lots of eating, drinking and laughing.\n\"Other clubs look at these trips and think they are stag parties,\" says Griffiths.\n\"It is far from that. It is a carefully-planned process to develop a group of people who will do whatever is necessary for each other and ultimately love each other.\"\nChris Ashton is a recent convert. The England winger, who arrived at Saracens via rugby league side Wigan and Premiership rivals Northampton, says the atmosphere is unlike any other dressing room he has been part of.\n\"When you are at a rugby club every day, you come in, do your work, train and go home to your families,\" he says. \"You don't really get to spend that much quality time as a group together.\n\"Those trips give everyone the opportunity just to get to know everyone a little bit better, and spend quality time together.\"\nSaracens' interpretation of quality time is different from what Ashton had experienced before. It is not just a question of banter. In fact, it isn't really banter at all.\nA natural extrovert, Ashton had a reputation at Northampton - and still has one with England - for being one of the loudest members of the dressing room.\nAt Saracens, however, humility is prized as one of the club's four key values and Ashton has reined in his boisterous, bantering instincts.\n\"When I was at Northampton I was in the middle of it, giving all the abuse out, but that is not a big part of what goes on here,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\"It's a bit hard to explain, but the environment is different and how the group want to be treated is different.\"\nWithin the Saracens staff there are 29 undergraduate degrees, 11 Masters degrees, one doctorate, two doctors and a professor. Brad Barritt (above) is soon to complete a Masters in business administration.\nThe globe-trotting mini-breaks are only the most eye-catching part of an approach that is designed to care for people as well as players.\nThe club require all their players to develop themselves off the pitch - through studying, work experience or running their own business - to prepare for life after rugby.\nSo centre Brad Barritt is about to complete a Masters in business administration, full-back Alex Goode has donned a shirt and tie to see how the insurance industry works and prop James Johnston's fledgling pie company is open for business at half-time at Allianz Park.\nEvery month on a Tuesday lunchtime, a speaker - after an introduction by a nervous young academy player - talks to the club as a whole.\nFormer England cricket captain Andrew Strauss, Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart and transatlantic rower Debra Searle are among those to appear at Saracens' St Albans training ground.\nThere are workshops to learn negotiating and networking skills, charity partnerships and social events for players' partners and creches and personalised Christmas gifts for their children.\nPaul Gustard was a player at the club before the arrival of Griffiths and Venter and has remained as defence coach.\n\"To a man, we have changed as people. Not only have we become a better rugby side, but we have become better people,\" he says.\n\"Nobody really comes to Saracens and leaves two years later like they did in the old days. They come here, play their career, retire and move on with a job we've helped them get.\n\"If you can have something that is over and above being a team-mate and be a genuine friend that I can ring up in 10 years' time, that is what I think Saracens is about.\"\nThe inevitable internal competition among a stellar squad could derail all these good intentions.\nBut each player is subjected to four separate psychological profiles. The results are shared with coaches and senior players, so instructions and advice can be delivered in the most constructive way possible.\nBefore taking up residence at their purpose-built Allianz Park home in 2012, Saracens had lead a nomadic existence, playing out of various London venues:\nNobody is ever \"dropped\", they are \"rotated\".\nIt may sound like semantics, but scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth won his starting place in Saracens' last Premiership final appearance only on a coin toss, with Neil de Kock replacing him in the 50th minute regardless of the state of the game.\nReducing results to a secondary concern and caring for, as well as paying, players requires healthy finances and a solid grounding towards the top of the Premiership table.\nBut Saracens have been well-backed before. Former owner Nigel Wray, who remains chairman of the club, brought in World Cup winners Francois Pienaar and Michael Lynagh and French stars Thomas Castaignede and Thierry Lacroix on big contracts.\nThe 1998 Tetley's Bitter Cup was the only silverware to follow.\nNow Saracens are regular challengers for silverware, Griffiths and his staff are aware how their approach may come across.\n\"The Saracens way is our way and it suits us, but we are not pious and preaching about it in any way at all,\" says Griffiths.\n\"I would never tell Leicester, Harlequins or Northampton how to run their clubs.\"\nHe doesn't need to. Players and coaches at all three clubs cannot fail to have been impressed by Saracens' record-breaking 46-6 Heineken Cup semi-final win over Clermont Auvergne.\nGriffiths says: \"The dividing line between success and failure in professional sport is incredibly thin; it is literally a matter of inches.\n\"If you get to know someone well - their wife, their children, what excites them, what concerns them - when you are defending your line in the last minute the bond between you and the man outside you is going to be stronger.\n\"If we can find an extra inch in that bond, in the depth that players are prepared to go for each other, in Miami, New York or anywhere else, that is where we will go.\"",

It is a gift to the agents to help them improve their situation.\"\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport\nGiven they have been in sixth place since early November, there is a real possibility that United will fail to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive year.\nThat would cost them more than \u00a320m in sponsorship income due to a clause in their \u00a3750m, 10-year deal with Adidas, but is unlikely to impact on their ability to attract top-class players because of Mourinho's reputation and the club's ability to pay top salaries.\nMourinho's priorities will be to bring in at least one \"game-changing forward\" and bolster his defence significantly.\nAtletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann has been heavily linked, although United officials have played down a story from France that personal terms with the 25-year-old have already been agreed.\nA formal move for Benfica's Victor Lindelof is anticipated after United ruled out a January move for the 22-year-old Sweden defender due to his near \u00a340m buyout clause.\nMonaco defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is also of interest to Mourinho, with England winger Ashley Young and Schweinsteiger top of the list of likely departures.",

Repairing it will take even longer than we hoped.\n\"But we held our nerve when many told us to abandon our plan. And as a result, thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of the British people, Britain is turning a corner.\n\"Of course, many risks remain. These are still the early stages of recovery. But we mustn't go back to square one. We mustn't lose what the British people have achieved.\n\"This is a hard, difficult road we have been following. But it is the only way to deliver a sustained, lasting improvement in the living standards of the British people.\"\nThe government's \"economic plan is the right response to Britain's macroeconomic imbalances and the evidence shows that it is working\", he said, in his address to an audience of academics, think tanks and businesses.\nMr Osborne said that those who advocated an alternative economic path could not explain recent improvements in the economic data.\nAnd \"the last few months have decisively ended\" the idea that the scale and pace of his measures were to blame for much slower than projected growth over recent years, he added.\n\"Those in favour of a Plan B have lost the argument,\" he said.\nHeeding calls to abandon the government's economic plan in order to spend and borrow more would have undermined the recovery and \"would be disastrous\" now, Mr Osborne said.\nHe pledged to remain \"vigilant\" to threats from abroad - including growing instability in the Middle East pushing up the oil price and a fresh eurozone crisis - as well as at home.\nJohn Cridland, director-general of business lobby group CBI, said the economy was gathering some momentum, business confidence was rising and he expected growth to continue into next year.\n\"We have always said that deficit reduction should be at the top of the government's 'to-do list', but it must be coupled with an unrelenting focus on growth-boosting measures like infrastructure projects,\" he said.\nBy Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor\nAnd he dismissed claims he was encouraging \"the wrong sort of growth\" - led by debt-fuelled consumer spending - insisting the evidence suggested \"tentative signs of a balanced, broad based and sustainable recovery\".\nHe said there were many tough decisions still to be taken and that \"the only sustainable path to prosperity is to reject the old quick fixes and stick to the course we have set\".\nLabour accused Mr Osborne of \"extraordinary complacency\".\nOpposition leader Ed Miliband told the BBC that the chancellor was \"saying to people that he has saved the British economy at a time when, for ordinary families, life is getting worse\".\n\"If ever you wanted proof that the government is out of touch with most people, that it is on the side of the few, George Osborne has provided it today,\" he added.",

It's also lonely.\"\nIn his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\".\n\"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say.\n\"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support.\n\"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week.\n\"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain.\n\"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\"\nAccording to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected \u00a3650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth \u00a31m free of death duties.\nBut the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance.\nLuke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do.\n\"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional \u00a3450 a year for carers since 2010.\n\"Labour have already committed the money from corporation tax cuts 11 times over, so there is no way they could find the additional money for this promise.\n\"It's not worth the paper it's written on - just like Labour's reputation for economic management.\"\nThe government has recently committed to spending an extra \u00a32bn on the social care system over the next three years and allowed local authorities to raise council tax bills in order to fund social care services.",

    "source": "Sir Bernard announced the move to reassure the public and deter attackers following terrorist attacks in Europe.\nThe Met has already said the number of armed officers will go up in London by 600 to 2,800.\nAnd a further 900 armed officers are planned to be in operation for the rest of England and Wales.\nBut Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said it may take two years to fully train the 1,500 recruits planned nationally.\n\"When you're recruiting 1,500 it's going to take a lot of time. You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",

You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",

It is reportedly home to more than 40% of all active Twitter users in the Arab region.\nSome key events in Saudi Arabia's history:\n1932 - The areas controlled by King Abd-al-Aziz are unified under the name Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n1938 - Oil is discovered and production begins under the US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company).\n1960 - Saudi Arabia is a founding member of Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries).\n1973 - Saudi Arabia leads an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the October War against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadruple.\n2001 11 September - 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacks on New York and Washington are Saudi nationals.\n2011 - As ''Arab Spring'' protests ripple across the region, Saudi troops participate in crackdown on unrest in Bahrain.\n2015 March - Saudi Arabia launches campaign of air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.",

    "source": "Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm.\nThe ceasefire was supposed to open the way to aid deliveries in Syria, followed by the rolling out of a co-ordinated military campaign by Moscow and Washington against so-called Islamic State (IS) targets and other groups linked to al-Qaeda.\nIn practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable.\nThe Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed.\nThe Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way.\nIn contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces.\nQuite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset.\nFirstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals.\nThe Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved.\nSecondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia.\nThe Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans.\nFurthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset.\nThe idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre.\nAny hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step.\nIn any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS.\nIf there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse.\nThe conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues.

We just focus on our work here and see how that one evolves.\n\"Pat at the moment is playing for Man City, he's featured for them, so I can't comment too much on it.\"\nDavies also confirmed there were no plans to bring in an extra central defender despite injuries to Dedryck Boyata and Erik Sviatchenko ahead of facing Astana of Kazakhstan over two legs on 16 and 22 August for a place in the Champions League group stage.\nBefore then, Celtic face Kilmarnock in the League Cup on Tuesday then travel to take on Partick Thistle in the Premiership.\n\"We've used Nir Bitton, who has played there before and done exceptionally well,\" said Davies. \"Kristoffer Ajer has filled in and Mikael Lustig can fill in as well - and we've got Jozo Simunovic.\n\"We're happy with what we've got going into tomorrow night. Astana is coming up, but we're comfortable.\n\"We're not in a desperate situation, we're comfortable and we've got six games coming up in the next 20 days, so we've got a squad we're going to have to use and everybody has to be ready.\"\nEnglishman Davies also confirmed that Celtic are talking to former winger Shaun Maloney over a coaching role at the club.\nThe 34-year-old began his career at Celtic Park, making more than 150 appearances for the Scottish champions, and the player is expected to retire after his proposed summer move to Aberdeen after leaving Hull City fell through because of persistent injuries.\n\"I can't give you anything definitive - it's something the club are looking at,\" Davies said. \"I've met him once or twice and been really impressed with him as a character and his thoughts on the game.\n\"He brings a lot of experience as a player and his Celtic connections as well.\n\"I think he would fit in really well if it were to happen. Any player that's been involved at a club as a player, especially if they've come through the academy, it gives them a good empathy for the players in that academy.\"",

    "source": "The 20-year-old spent 18 months with the Scottish champions but is also wanted by Nice and at least two English Premier League clubs.\nCeltic assistant Chris Davies confirmed on Monday that his club maintain \"a constant dialogue\" with Roberts.\n\"There is always going to be a home for him here if that suits everybody,\" Davies said.\n\"They have been talking and the situation is always open to a certain extent because the transfer window is still open.\n\"We've got the players that are with us working and fighting right now, we've been scoring and creating goals, so if something extra happens then it's all positive, but if not, we're OK.\"\nNice, who face Napoli in the Champions League play-off round, have already added two players to their midfield options this week, with Wesley Sneijder, previously of Galatasaray, signing on Tuesday following the acquisition of Allan Saint-Maximin from Lique 1 rivals Monaco.\nBut Roberts is ready to tell his parent club that his own choice would be Celtic.\n\"All I know from our part is that we value the player, rate the player, and I'm sure if it was right for everybody then something would be done,\" said Davies.\n\"But we can't really control that at the moment. We just focus on our work here and see how that one evolves.\n\"Pat at the moment is playing for Man City, he's featured for them, so I can't comment too much on it.\"\nDavies also confirmed there were no plans to bring in an extra central defender despite injuries to Dedryck Boyata and Erik Sviatchenko ahead of facing Astana of Kazakhstan over two legs on 16 and 22 August for a place in the Champions League group stage.\nBefore then, Celtic face Kilmarnock in the League Cup on Tuesday then travel to take on Partick Thistle in the Premiership.\n\"We've used Nir Bitton, who has played there before and done exceptionally well,\" said Davies. \"Kristoffer Ajer has filled in and Mikael Lustig can fill in as well - and we've got Jozo Simunovic.\n\"We're happy with what we've got going into tomorrow night. Astana is coming up, but we're comfortable.\n\"We're not in a desperate situation, we're comfortable and we've got six games coming up in the next 20 days, so we've got a squad we're going to have to use and everybody has to be ready.\"\nEnglishman Davies also confirmed that Celtic are talking to former winger Shaun Maloney over a coaching role at the club.\nThe 34-year-old began his career at Celtic Park, making more than 150 appearances for the Scottish champions, and the player is expected to retire after his proposed summer move to Aberdeen after leaving Hull City fell through because of persistent injuries.\n\"I can't give you anything definitive - it's something the club are looking at,\" Davies said. \"I've met him once or twice and been really impressed with him as a character and his thoughts on the game.\n\"He brings a lot of experience as a player and his Celtic connections as well.\n\"I think he would fit in really well if it were to happen. Any player that's been involved at a club as a player, especially if they've come through the academy, it gives them a good empathy for the players in that academy.\"",

It doesn't look like the last 50 or so replies from today have been added to the listing. Sorry people - looks like you have broken eBay.\"\nOn the comments pages, one user described Mr Andresier as a \"marketing genius\", while another did not see the funny side and said he was \"pathetic\".\nHe said he would use the proceeds from the sale to \"help me recover from children\".\nMr Andresier's wife Susan, 36, had said she found the listing \"hilarious\", and added the couple had been amazed by its popularity on social media.\n'Green monster' for sale: Highlights from the eBay listing\n\"I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy.

His break building and his match play has been fantastic. But I think he needed to win the last frame. The way he dominated the session, if he hadn't come out of it at least 6-2 he would have been kicking himself.\"",

    "source": "Four days after the launch of the anti-corruption move, long queues continue outside ATMs as people try to exchange the 500 ($7) and 1,000 notes.\n\"It had to be done suddenly but I never thought I will receive blessings for this,\" Mr Modi said.\nHe hinted that other measures aimed at fighting corruption and the black economy might follow.\nUrging people to be patient, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it would take a few weeks for banks and ATMs to completely replace the old notes, estimated to make up some 85% of the total currency in circulation.\nMr Jaitley said that nearly $30bn in the old notes had so far been deposited in banks across the country.\nBut chaotic scenes can still be witnessed outside banks as public patience is beginning to wear out, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi.\nSome traders and small business owners have threatened to go on strike because they have been badly affected, our correspondent says.\nThe opposition has also been critical of the move, saying the rural and urban poor have been hit hardest.\nBut Mr Modi thanked his fellow countrymen who had \"accepted the decision in national interest\".\nAnd he warned that there was \"no guarantee\" that new measures would not follow after the note-exchange scheme ends on 30 December.\nHe said \"no-one would be spared\" in the drive against corruption. But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.\nAfter Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.\nThousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.\nThere are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.\nThe 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.\nPeople will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.\nThe actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.\nAn individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.\nNew 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.\nA new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.\nThey can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",

    "source": "Four days after the launch of the anti-corruption move, long queues continue outside ATMs as people try to exchange the 500 ($7) and 1,000 notes.\n\"It had to be done suddenly but I never thought I will receive blessings for this,\" Mr Modi said.\nHe hinted that other measures aimed at fighting corruption and the black economy might follow.\nUrging people to be patient, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it would take a few weeks for banks and ATMs to completely replace the old notes, estimated to make up some 85% of the total currency in circulation.\nMr Jaitley said that nearly $30bn in the old notes had so far been deposited in banks across the country.\nBut chaotic scenes can still be witnessed outside banks as public patience is beginning to wear out, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi.\nSome traders and small business owners have threatened to go on strike because they have been badly affected, our correspondent says.\nThe opposition has also been critical of the move, saying the rural and urban poor have been hit hardest.\nBut Mr Modi thanked his fellow countrymen who had \"accepted the decision in national interest\".\nAnd he warned that there was \"no guarantee\" that new measures would not follow after the note-exchange scheme ends on 30 December.\nHe said \"no-one would be spared\" in the drive against corruption. But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.\nAfter Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.\nThousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.\nThere are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.\nThe 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.\nPeople will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.\nThe actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.\nAn individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.\nNew 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.\nA new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.\nThey can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",

    "source": "But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined.\nThe US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it.\nAs news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration.\nBut there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out.\nThe Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football.\nThis is not just about sport of course.\nThe Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call \"internationalisation\" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa.\nThe issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote.\nThis time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote.\n\"I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,\" he told me. \"It is our right.\"\nThe Palestinians believe their case is strong.\nThey complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games.\nThe point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank.\nIt's not a rare event.

    "source": "But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined.\nThe US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it.\nAs news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration.\nBut there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out.\nThe Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football.\nThis is not just about sport of course.\nThe Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call \"internationalisation\" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa.\nThe issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote.\nThis time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote.\n\"I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,\" he told me. \"It is our right.\"\nThe Palestinians believe their case is strong.\nThey complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games.\nThe point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank.\nIt's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained.

If you're worried - you act. Call an ambulance.\"\nHe says it's safer for one person in a group of friends to take a small amount of a drug to tests its effects, than for a whole group to take a full dose at the same time.\nDr Winstock says: \"There has been an increase in deaths involving PMMA in the last three years.\"\nHe believes the chemical has been implicated in at least 22 deaths in the past year.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube",

    "source": "The plastic moulded figures, rebranded from the US GI Joe version, made their debut in the UK at the British Toy Fair in Brighton, in January 1966, after a toy executive realised their market potential.\nThe early toys were imports but Palitoy, based in Coalville, Leicestershire, would go on to make its own version with \"lifelike hair\", \"beards\" and \"gripping hands\" in the early 1970s.\nAccording to Rob Burman, editor of the Collectors Gazette, Palitoy bosses gave strict instructions not to call them \"dolls\" as boys could be put off.\nThey were hugely popular, with sales topping 20 million by the end of the 1970s.\nModifications kept the toys fresh and collectable, for example \"eagle eyes\" were introduced in 1976 by Hasbro, the US makers, and Palitoy brought in \"flocked\" hair and non-military costumes such as football kits.\nHowever, despite a loyal band of collectors, the success did not last into the 1980s.\n\"The 60s and 70s were the big times for Action Man and then Star Wars came along,\" said Mr Burman.\n\"Everyone wanted intergalactic characters, they weren't bothered about poor old Action Man.\"\nThe toy expert said the figure made a bit of a comeback in the 1990s but nowadays people are generally more \"politically correct\" and so there is little interest in soldier toys.\nHowever, there is still a thirst for the old outfits - a boxed judo costume recently sold for ??6,000 at auction.\nChris Malbon, 58, from Nottingham, who runs Warwickshire-based Metropolis Toys, had at one time one of the most \"comprehensive\" Action Man collections in the UK.\nHe started collecting in 1989 and spent thousands on his acquisitions, which he admits got a \"bit out of hand\", and he later he sold them all for a \"substantial\" fee.\n\"I collected the entire range,\" said the trader. \"Both boxed and loose, together with US, French, German, Spanish, Japanese variations. I guess around 200 figures.\"\nHowever, it all became a bit of a burden.\nHe said: \"It's not because of the money... you end up wanting that elusive item or upgrading what you have to the exclusion of other things.\"\nMr Malbon, a former soldier himself, did not want to say what he sold his collection for but said it was as much as he paid for his house in the 1990s.\nPalitoy's former chief toy designer Bob Brechin, who modelled Action Man's gripping hands on his own, said the toy has endured.\n\"It's hard to believe it has been 50 years,\" he said.\n\"He's timeless, universal, we never gave Action Man a story, we just gave children [the figures] and the outfits you dress him in and left it to their imaginations.\"\nHasbro has announced it is releasing a set of vintage figures as part of the anniversary celebrations.\nIt seems Action Man is not quite ready to leave the battlefield.",

He was applauded as he took his seat in the stand.\nRangers will also have to appoint a new nominated advisor - the company that manages Rangers International Football Club's listing on the Alternative Investment Market.\nThe company's previous 'nomad', WH Ireland, resigned ahead of the EGM, which resulted in the shares being suspended.\nA new nomad must be appointed within 30 days or the company will be de-listed from the Stock Exchange.\nKing has stated Rangers need more than \u00a320m invested in the near future to get the club into a competitive position.\nThe team currently sit third in the Scottish Championship and the play-offs appear to be their best hope for promotion, with leaders Hearts on course for the title.",

    "source": "They trailed by seven at the break as Rob Kearney, Josh van der Flier and Zane Kirchner crossed to cancel out scores from Seymour and Tim Swinson.\nScotland winger Seymour then lacerated Leinster with three predatory strikes after the break.\nThe bonus-point win sees Warriors level on points with Pro12 leaders Ospreys.\nThis was a compelling shoot-out between two Pro12 heavyweights who have fought some thunderous bouts in the recent past.\nThe defending was often porous - Glasgow's missed tackle count hitting double figures, while Leinster were manipulated by the speed and variety of the Warriors attack.\nWhen the opening try came, it was textbook Glasgow. After punishing carries from Jonny Gray and then Leonardo Sarto took the Warriors into the Leinster 22, the ball was swept to the opposite wing, with Sam Johnson zipping a sumptuous pass for Seymour to scamper in at the corner.\nCo-captain Henry Pyrgos missed the conversion, and the rest of the half belonged chiefly to the Irish province.\nTheir pack were heaved into touch as they rumbled towards the freshly painted whitewash but it was a temporary reprieve for Glasgow, reliant on last-ditch breakdown scrapping with the visitors repeatedly puncturing their midfield.\nEventually they crumbled, the Ireland full-back, Rob Kearney, scything through two missed tackles and finishing well at the corner, young pivot Joey Carbery converting magnificently from the touchline.\nThe response from Glasgow was immediate and resounding. Swinson capped a spell of rapid, aggressive phase play, neatly orchestrated by Pete Horne at fly-half, by driving over between the posts, Pyrgos converting, barely two minutes after Kearney's try.\nBack surged Leinster and Sarto was dispatched to the sin-bin for infringing metres from his own line.\nIt culminated in a comically simple try for Van der Flier as the flanker scooped up the ball from the ruck and exploited the lack of any discernible fringe defence, shrugging off Simone Favaro's lunge and sprinting under the posts, Carbery again adding the conversion.\nThen, with the clock red, Leinster pounced again, Kirchner gathering Carbery's delicate crosskick on the bounce and racing in for an unconverted score and a seven-point half-time lead.\nThat advantage was bolstered by Carbery's penalty four minutes into the second period as Glasgow struggled to exit cleanly from their own half.\nHowever, if the first 40 minutes belonged to Leinster, the second was sole property of Seymour as the Pro12's hottest finisher produced an irrepressible combination of speed, power and opportunism to turn the game on its head.\nFirst, he plucked Carbery's pass from the air to dot down under the posts for Pyrgos to convert.\nThen, a minute later, he seized on another loose Leinster pass to spin out of a tackle and out-pace the chasing defence to the line.\nWith Pyrgos' conversion, suddenly the Warriors led.\nCarbery cut the deficit to a point with a penalty just after the hour, but it was Seymour who had the emphatic final word.\nFrom a scrummage deep in the Leinster 22, he fizzed brilliantly on to Pyrgos' inside flick, the winger's momentum carrying him towards a remarkable fourth try - his sixth in two matches - and an easy conversion for his co-captain.\nA dynamic and fitting climax as Glasgow followed last week's rout of defending champions Connacht with this high-octane defeat of the early title favourites.\nGlasgow Warriors: Hogg, Sarto, Dunbar, Johnson, Seymour, Horne, Pyrgos, Reid, Brown, Puafisi, Swinson, Gray, Harley, Favaro, Wilson.\nReplacements: Flynn (for Brown, 68), Allan (for Reid, 68), Fagerson (for Puafisi, 49), Uanivi (for Swinson, 77), Wynne (for Favaro, 68), Jones (for Sarto, 68).\nNot Used: Price, Clegg.\nYellow card: Sarto (36).\nLeinster: R. Kearney, McFadden, G. Ringrose, Reid, D. Kearney, Carbery, L. McGrath, Healy, Tracy, Bent, McCarthy, Molony, Leavy, van der Flier, Murphy.\nReplacements: B.

That said more about what RAR was about than any of the slogans we may have shouted from the stage.\"\nHe added: \"I hope the exhibition shows that you can change things and you can actually take a stand, even in the most difficult of situations.\n\"If it inspires people to be photographers that would be great but I hope it will also inspire people to fight against racism and inequality.\"",

    "source": "Christopher Hannah was driving a car which mounted the pavement and struck Sophie Brannan in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, on 14 November last year.\nHer friend Chelsea Sommerville, and Chelsea's uncle, Joseph Lloyd, were also badly injured.\nAt the High Court in Glasgow, 33-year-old Hannah, who is said to be a heroin addict, admitted a charge of culpable homicide. Sentence was deferred.\nFollowing his guilty plea, the investigating officer Det Insp Colin Hailstones said: \"This was an appallingly tragic case.\n\"Many people in the community in Maryhill were deeply affected by this incident, particularly as it resulted in the death of young Sophie Brannan, whose life was sadly taken away from her at the age of 11 and at the hands of someone under the influence of drugs.\n\"Police officers worked tirelessly to piece together the events of that fateful night and I must thank the many members of the local community and those injured who helped provide information about the incident.\"\nHe added: \"The strength shown from the community towards Sophie's family and the other people who were injured is unquestionable and much support continues to be given to them.\"\nThe court heard that Hannah was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the area and lost control.\nHe then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building.\nThe car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind.\nProsecutor Allan Nicol said: \"This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground.\"\nAnother driver witnessed the crash and turned back to help Sophie.\nMore witnesses saw Hannah speed onto nearby Maryhill Road with his badly-dented car being \"driven erratically\".\nHe then crashed into a taxi whose driver decided to follow Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away.\nMr Nicol added: \"At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off.\n\"Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed that he was under the influence of some substance.\"\nMedics found Sophie lying on the pavement. She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones.\nThe schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight but was pronounced dead on the morning of 15 November.\nThe court heard that Chelsea suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy.\nShe continues to wear a cast several months after the tragedy.\nMr Nicol added: \"She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts.\n\"She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.\"\nChelsea's uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later.\nHowever, he eventually required surgery and it is likely he will have \"long-term restriction\" of movement in his right shoulder.\nPolice discovered the Astra had been hired in Hannah's name on 14 October.\nThe court also heard that shortly after the incident, police searched the home of Hannah's partner, where he had been staying.\nMr Nicol said tin foil wraps with signs of drug use were discovered.\nThe prosecutor told the court: \"On the day in question, she suspected he had been taking heroin as she was aware he is heroin-dependent.\"\nHis partner revealed Hannah had come home earlier that night \"in shock\".\nHannah had claimed he had hit someone, but did not know who.\nThe killer said he was going to a house in the city's south side, but would return.\nPolice were at the house when Hannah then called his girlfriend. She handed the phone to an officer and Hannah said: \"I'm sorry - I didn't mean to do it.\n\"It was a total accident. I lost control of the car and I panicked. I'm going to hand myself in tonight.\"\nThe court heard that in the early hours of 17 November, Hannah turned up at a house in the city's Mount Florida area, but those inside decided to call police.\nOfficers turned up and arrested Hannah, who initially tried to escape. He was later searched and eight grams of heroin were discovered inside his boxer shorts.\nThe court heard how the occupants of the Mount Florida property later told police Hannah had called them on the night of the killing.\nHannah said at the time: \"There's been an accident - watch the news. The police have fitted me up.\n\"I tried to get away and I have hit something. I don't know what.\"\nMr Nicol told the court: \"He went on to say he had driven like a madman and that the something he had hit could have been a wheelie bin...but he didn't hang about to find out.\"\nHannah asked to stay for a while as the police were after him \"because he had killed a wee lassie\".\nAccident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for what happened.\nIt was stated he took \"a conscious decision\" to drive while \"impaired\".\nThey added that the reason for him not stopping was because he knew he had taken drugs and was \"aware of the ramifications\".\nAs well as culpable homicide, Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin.\nIt emerged he already had 14 previous convictions for crimes including having an offensive weapon and road traffic charges.\nHe was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash.\nHannah's advocate Thomas Ross said: \"He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.\"\nLord Bannatyne remanded Hannah in custody and deferred sentencing until May.",

The sky glowed orange as huge clouds of smoke billowed and thickened the air with dust. The pungent whiff of burning wood and the smell of powdered brick and plaster lingered.\nTwo waves of bombs pounded the city from 20:00 GMT on 22 December, only ending at 06:00 the next day.\nAmong the buildings hit in the heart of the city were Manchester's Free Trade Hall, the Royal Exchange, Smithfield Market, Cheethams Hospital, the Gaiety Theatre and St Ann's Church.\nIn total, 684 people died and a further 2,300 were wounded with districts to the north and east of the city badly affected, notably Cheetham Hill and Strangeways. At least 8,000 homes were made uninhabitable.\nDuring the war as a whole, 1,400 civilians died in Manchester, so the raid represents almost half those killed.

If water mains were damaged, they would drink water from bowsers.\nFather George Street, 34, who had spent all night helping people amid the bombing, died when the church of St Augustine in York Street took a direct hit.

Then this man would play the piano accordion and sing war songs.\n\"Everyone would be singing along and I don't remember getting any sleep in the shelter.\"\nSusan Jones, 16 at the time, was shopping in Ancoats as the bombs started dropping.

The sight of several cockroaches scuttling across the shelter led her to volunteer for fire warden duties on the factory roof.\n\"The shrapnel started coming down and one bit hit a wall of one of the big mills,\" she said. \"I could see sparks and I was hugging the wall to try and stay safe.

There was an acrid smell of burning and from the guns. The sky was all orange and yellow it looked like the fireworks I'd seen at Belle Vue when I was younger.\"\nHistorian Ian Kikuchi, from the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford, said there had been few fatalities in Manchester until the Christmas Blitz.\n\"The heaviest bombing previously had been in the East End of London,\" he said. \"The Luftwaffe launched bombings across Britain as they were trying to disrupt food supply and were targeting ports and centres of distribution.\"\nMr Kikuchi said the Germans bombed Coventry in November 1940 because of its strategic position in heavy industry, but the focus soon shifted to other cities across Britain.\nHe said the raids had been anticipated by British intelligence. \"What was surprising was the intensity of the raids,\" he said.\n\"The Luftwaffe saw Manchester as an adjunct to the port of Liverpool, which was a major industrial centre.\"",

The Crystal Palace player was unfortunate to be wrong-footed by Nani's deflection for the second goal.\nWatchful against the threat of Ronaldo cutting inside from Portugal's left, the Reading defender was kept busy by the likes of Renato Sanches and Nani and struggled to influence the game in attack.\nSwitched to the left side of Wales' three centre-backs in Ben Davies' absence, the West Brom man timed his advances well to make interceptions. Beaten by Ronaldo for Portugal's opening goal but won a team-high eight aerial duels.\nMade some strong early challenges, particularly on Cristiano Ronaldo, to assert his authority on the game. The Swansea City skipper led by example, winning 100% of his 50-50 contests with Portugal players.\nMaking his first international start since March 2015, he competed well in the air as Portugal sought to make the most of Ronaldo's aerial prowess. Wales might have missed Ben Davies' distribution but his replacement was solid defensively.\nLike Gunter, kept on the back foot by Portugal's attacking players. Pushed forward but, when he got into promising positions, struggled to provide quality crosses.\nAn early booking for a foul on Nani made his job of protecting Wales' defence difficult, but still the Liverpool midfielder buzzed around with intent. Typically sound in possession but not as influential as he has been earlier in the tournament.\nShowed imagination with a low corner which led to a chance for Gareth Bale but had only limited influence in open play before being replaced by Sam Vokes shortly after Portugal's second goal.\nMade some characteristic runs into the Portugal penalty area but could not make the crucial connections. Forced deeper as Portugal's midfield gained control in the second half, the Leicester Premier League winner had to curb his attacking instincts.\nTrademark runs from deep and at a startling pace had Portugal's defenders backtracking in the first half but his influence waned in the second period. The Real Madrid forward's audacious long-range shot was Wales' last effort.\nBrimming with confidence following his stunning goal in the quarter-final win over Belgium, the free agent stretched Portugal's defence with his powerful running. He was starved of the ball in the second half, however, as the match wore on.\nBrought on shortly after Wales fell 2-0 behind, the Burnley striker failed to connect meaningfully with any of the crosses which came his way.\nDid not see much of the ball and, when he did, was not in a position to cause Portugal any problems.\nTried making his usual probing runs between the opponents' midfield and defence but found himself crowded out.",

    "source": "Motorcycles used as taxis and known as boda bodas are time-savers for people who need to get somewhere in Tanzania's north-western city of Mwanza.\nThey seem to be the only way to beat traffic jams. But when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver, you are actually putting your life in his hands.\nIn the first half of this year, there were more than 5,000 road accidents in Tanzania. More than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents.\nBoda boda drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on Mwanza's roads. They might get you where you want to go quickly, but they have a reputation for driving recklessly.\nThere are hundreds of them competing for fares, which increases the risk of accidents.\nBut that is also where trainee doctor Marko Hingi saw an opportunity to turn boda boda drivers into true life-savers.\nHe was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in Mwanza, there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby.\n\"We have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help,\" says Mr Hingi, who works at a hospital in the city.\nHe is also head of the Tanzania Rural Health Movement, which recruits boda boda drivers and turns them into first-responders, acting like paramedics.\n\"In the past when somebody got injured, he bled while people looked at him until he died,\" says Anicet Mase, one of Mr Hingi's volunteer drivers.\nNow Mr Mase zips around Mwanza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first-aid kit.\nHe and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first-aid, such as keeping airways open, stopping bleeding and splinting fractured bones.\nThe drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called Beacon.\nMwanza's fire station receives calls reporting emergencies.\nA dispatcher enters the details into the Beacon software, which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system.\nIf a motorcycle taxi driver is nearby, he can respond to the emergency.\n\"We've designed [the Beacon] to be used in countries that don't have the resources to implement a robust EMS [Emergency Medical Services] system,\" says Michael McGee, the East Africa representative of Trek Medics International, which developed Beacon and runs a similar programme in the Dominican Republic.\nThis \"robust\" service involves people calling for ambulances on emergency numbers such as 999, 112 or 911.\nBut this is expensive and does not exist in many poorer countries. It is up to the sick and injured to get to hospital any way they can.\nWhen Mr Hingi was six he remembers his sick mother walking to hospital, worrying that wild dogs would attack her on the way.\nThat childhood memory inspired Mr Hingi's dream to become a doctor and bring ambulances to Mwanza.\n\"Communities are suffering because they lack a good system to help them,\" he says.\nAs for Mr Mase, he is driven by the idea that boda boda drivers are now given the opportunity to counter their bad reputation for putting lives at risk on the roads.\nA big part of his work is to deal with injuries caused on the roads.\nAbout 90% of the 1.25 million people killed every year in traffic accidents die in low and middle income countries.\nHowever, there is a limit to what motorbike drivers can do to help.\nSome of Tanzania's roads are in too bad a condition for them to reach patients and evacuate them safely.\nSo, even though the motorcycles in Mwanza find it easier to avoid potholes and wind through traffic, there is work to be done before boda boda drivers can really claim to be saving lives rather than putting them at risk.",

That is something Liverpool just didn't do.\n\"They had one stonewall penalty in the first half but when you go in 1-0 up at half-time in a cup final, what is the first thing anyone says in the dressing room?\n\"You make sure you don't concede in the first 10 or 20 minutes. What did Liverpool do? They conceded in the first 17 seconds.\"\nLeft-back Alberto Moreno was at fault for Sevilla's first goal, and Lawrenson was also critical of the 23-year-old's performance.\n\"Yet again Moreno, who used to play for Sevilla, has made a massive mistake,\" he said.\n\"I've lost count of how many mistakes this guy has made.\n\"It's all very good pouring forward but the clue is in the title - left-back. Try defending occasionally. Moreno has made mistakes all season - basic errors.\n\"Where was he for Villarreal's goal the other week? He was trying to score a goal at the other end.\"\nLawrenson said former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked in October, had to share the blame for not strengthening the left-back area during his tenure.\nHe added: \"Liverpool didn't have, by the end of August, another player who could play left-back unless they moved Nathaniel Clyne from the right.\n\"Jose Enrique was never going to play. I'm sorry, Brendan Rodgers gets the blame for me.\"\nLawrenson expects a summer of change at Anfield, but expects Sturridge and Brazilian duo Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho to stay.\n\"I'd imagine Liverpool have spoken to agents and will have an indication of whether players are coming,\" he said.\n\"If you are in a room with Klopp then I'd think it was hard to say no to him. This summer's transfer window is going to be the biggest ever in the Premier League in terms of money spent.\n\"Firmino, Coutinho and Sturridge are not going anywhere this summer - other than on holiday.\n\"Klopp knew within two weeks of taking over he needed to bring in players.\n\"Why didn't he address it in January? He probably did but could not get the right personnel in.\"",

    "source": "Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone.\nICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second.\nDanny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish.\nInverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership.\nTheir rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.\n\"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.\n\"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.\n\"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

    "source": "Ireland team manager Mick Kearney said that the Irish are adopting a \"wait and see\" attitude over centre Payne's recovery from a hamstring injury.\nIf Payne is ruled out, his Ulster colleague Stuart McCloskey will be in contention for a first cap.\nProps Mike Ross and Cian Healy are available to bolster the scrum after missing Ireland's first two games.\nThe Irish scrum struggled badly in the second half of the defeat by France and the return of the Leinster duo after injury will be a boost to coach Joe Schmidt.\nLoose-head Healy has returned to Leinster duty in recent weeks after knee surgery while tight-head Ross has recovered from hamstring trouble.\n\"They both participated in Leinster's last two games and both got a significant amount of game-time at the weekend against Cardiff,\" said Kearney of Healy and Ross on Monday afternoon.\n\"So they're in, fully fit and available for selection.\"\nKearney appeared less certain of Payne's fitness.\n\"Jared Payne is continuing his rehab and the hope is that he will train fully tomorrow,\" added the Ireland team manager.\n\"He did some running last week and will continue with that rehab today.\"\nPayne was initially thought to have suffered a dead leg in the Paris game but it was later diagnosed as a hamstring problem.\nFears over Johnny Sexton's fitness appear to have eased after he picked up a neck injury in Paris and then strained an ankle in training on Friday.\nRoss and Healy join Ulster wing Craig Gilroy plus Munster lock Dave Foley and Leinster flanker Jordi Murphy in being added to the Ireland squad for the Twickenham contest.\nMunster pair Keith Earls and Simon Zebo, who started in the draw against Wales, are included after missing the defeat by France because of injury.\nSean O'Brien, Dave Kearney and Mike McCarthy have all been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after picking up injuries in the France game.\nUlster flanker Chris Henry remains a notable absentee, despite starting for his province in the defeat by the Scarlets.\nAfter the daunting match against England, Joe Schmidt's side then finish their campaign with home games against Italy and Scotland on 12 and 19 March.\nThe holders' chances of retaining the title they won in 2014 and 2015 look remote, with just one point from their opening two fixtures.\nIreland squad: Forwards: Finlay Bealham (Connacht), Rory Best (Ulster), Sean Cronin (Leinster), Ultan Dillane (Connacht), Dave Foley (Munster), Cian Healy (Leinster), Jamie Heaslip (Leinster), Jack McGrath (Leinster), Jordi Murphy (Leinster), Tommy O'Donnell (Munster), Mike Ross (Leinster), Rhys Ruddock (Leinster), Donnacha Ryan (Munster), CJ Stander (Munster), Richardt Strauss (Leinster), Devin Toner (Leinster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Nathan White (Connacht).\nBacks: Keith Earls (Munster), Craig Gilroy (Ulster), Robbie Henshaw (Connacht), Paddy Jackson (Ulster), Rob Kearney (Leinster), Ian Madigan (Leinster), Kieran Marmion (Connacht), Luke Marshall (Ulster), Stuart McCloskey (Ulster), Fergus McFadden (Leinster), Conor Murray (Munster), Jared Payne (Ulster), Eoin Reddan (Leinster), Jonathan Sexton (Leinster), Andrew Trimble (Ulster), Simon Zebo (Munster).",

    "source": "Dear President Tusk\nOn 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\nEarlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.\nToday, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.\nSee the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF)\nThis letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.\nIt is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.\nI would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.\nAs I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \"acquis\") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.\nFrom the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\nThe United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\nIf, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.\nIt is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.\nLooking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.\ni. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no \"cherry picking\". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets.\nii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights.\niii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\niv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process.\nv. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.\nvi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.\nvii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.\nAs I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May",

The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May",

    "source": "Dear President Tusk\nOn 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\nEarlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.\nToday, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.\nSee the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF)\nThis letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.\nIt is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.\nI would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.\nAs I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \"acquis\") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.\nFrom the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\nThe United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\nIf, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.\nIt is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.\nLooking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.\ni. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no \"cherry picking\". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets.\nii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights.\niii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\niv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process.\nv. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.\nvi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.\nvii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.\nAs I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May",

    "source": "Rafa Benitez's ill-fated reign had left Los Blancos trailing both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga, with points dropped in four of their previous eight games and memories still fresh of a humiliating 4-0 home thrashing by Barca.\nNow, less than nine months later, not only are Zidane's Real the European champions, they are also on the verge of breaking La Liga's all-time record for consecutive victories.\nSunday's 2-0 triumph at Espanyol was the 16th straight victory for Zidane's men, who ended last season just one point behind champions Barca after winning their final 12 games. This season they have established early control of top spot with maximum points from four games.\nThat winning streak is a Real record and also equals the best winning sequence in Spain's top flight, achieved by Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barca in 2010-11.\nAnd they have the chance to beat that on Wednesday with victory over Villarreal at the Bernabeu.\nSo, how has Zidane done it? Not in the way you might have expected.\nSaturday, 27 February 2016 was a major turning point in 44-year-old Zidane's early managerial career.\nReal lost their derby at home to Atletico 1-0, jeered off by dissatisfied fans who felt the team had failed to progress since Benitez's exit.\nUntil then, Zidane had shoe-horned as many attacking players into his line-ups as possible in an attempt to fulfil his pledge to deliver the kind of exciting, free-flowing football associated with his playing days.\nIt wasn't working. The forwards were getting in each other's way and the lack of defensive instincts in midfield was making the team vulnerable, brutally exposed by the way Atletico strolled unchallenged through the centre of the pitch for Antoine Griezmann's match-winner.\nZidane knew something had to change - and that something was the introduction of defensive midfielder Casemiro, the low-profile Brazilian who had previously only played 23 minutes under his management.\nCasemiro, 24, moved to the Bernabeu from Sao Paulo in February 2013, making his debut under Jose Mourinho in a 3-1 home win over Real Betis two months later.\nBut Carlo Ancelotti sent him on loan to Porto for the season in the summer of 2014, then he was largely left on the bench by Benitez and initially by Zidane, with both managers compromised by the pressure to field more flamboyant, attacking talents.\nHowever, derby defeat forced Zidane to rethink, and Casemiro rapidly became indispensable, with his powerful physique, tackling ability and positional discipline giving the team a previously lacking defensive presence in midfield.\nReal began their winning streak with a 3-1 triumph at Levante, and were five victories into it when the game that would prove to be their turning point arrived: the Clasico at Barcelona on 2 April.\nBarca were paying tribute to club legend Johan Cruyff, who had died a week earlier, and they had every intention of marking his memory with another crushing victory over their biggest rivals.\nInstead, it proved to be a prototype performance from Zidane's new-look team, who were undeterred by falling behind to Gerard Pique's header and bounced back to win with goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThere was little flair in Real's victory, but the players obeyed Zidane's command - delivered in the wake of the defeat by Atletico - to \"run more\".\nNotably, the French coach delivered the same message in the build-up to the Champions League final against their city rivals in May, urging: \"What we have to do is run, run, run and run.\"\nForget spectacular, attacking football inspired by megastar Galacticos, Zidane was turning his team into a bunch of grafters committed to their defensive duties and increasingly confident in their ability to grind out wins even when not playing well.\nSeven of Real's past 19 victories have been secured by goals in the last 10 minutes - most recently the Champions League triumph over Sporting Lisbon which prompted Marca to hail them as \"Comeback FC\" and state Zidane has \"recovered the virtue of never giving up\".\nAlthough his strongest XI more or less picks itself, Zidane is committed to a policy of squad rotation, regularly emphasising the importance of a group mentality and insisting every player is important.\nEvery manager says similar things but Zidane's talk is not just empty rhetoric, with his commitment to rotation backed up by statistics.\nHe has fielded 21 players in Real's four league games this season - and only goalkeeper Kiko Casilla (deputising for Keylor Navas) and Sergio Ramos have started all four.\nFurthermore, Zidane has selected five different forward lines in his team's six competitive games, and their 12 league goals have been scored by 11 different players. You can't get much more 'group mentality' than that.\nSpain's most famously pro-Real journalist, Tomas Roncero from newspaper AS, this week saluted Zidane by writing: \"Zidane leads a squad of 24 players, not 11.\n\"This squad doesn't just have a plan B, but also a plan C and plan D. I've never seen a Madrid so complete, versatile, and reliable.\"\nThat tribute is also, naturally, an unspoken dig at Barcelona, who are routinely accused of being too reliant upon their Messi-Suarez-Neymar forward line and, when the second-stringers started at home to Alaves 10 days ago, lost 2-1.\nNot many managers could leave out a player for months, recall him to the starting line-up, see him score a record-breaking goal and then hear that player declare the manager \"will always be my idol\".\nBut Zidane was given that endorsement by James Rodriguez after the Colombia international, making his first start of the season, rifled home the opener in Real's hard-earned 2-0 victory at Espanyol on Sunday.\nAnd it's clear that Zidane, a 1998 World Cup winner with France who became a Real legend with a brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final victory over Bayer Leverkusen, is benefitting from the credibility provided by his stellar playing career.\nZidane commands automatic respect - and his aura makes it easier for him to retain good relationships with players he leaves out of the team.\nSo, too, does his constant reassertion of the team ethic and his commitment to squad rotation - it's much easier for dropped players to stay motivated when they know they have a genuine chance of starting next week.\nConsidering his penchant for petulance during his playing days, it is perhaps surprising that another quality which has helped Zidane manage Real's egos is his calm and composed personality.\nWhether on the sidelines, in front of the media or at the training ground, Zidane looks relaxed and always ready to smile, even maintaining his good-humoured patience when asked, as he has been countless times this summer, whether he was intending to sell James.\nIf you ask Barcelona fans whether Zidane is a great manager, they will scoff and say he is a lucky manager.\nWhen asked on social media for his hopes from the Champions League, Barca star Pique ironically replied he would like the kind of campaign enjoyed by Real last season.\n\"Easy group. Third-placed team in Italy in the last 16 [Roma], eighth in Germany in the quarters [Wolfsburg], fourth in England in the semis [Man City]. Return leg always at home,\" Pique tweeted.\nAnd it's true that Real - with all those late winners - have enjoyed some fortune during their record-breaking run, most recently when Sergio Ramos avoided a second yellow card for handball at Espanyol on Sunday by successfully pretending the ball hit his face.\nAlthough the \"lucky\" argument only takes you so far, it's certainly too soon to proclaim Zidane as an unqualified coaching triumph. The season is young and it's never wise to bank on too much stability in the soap opera that is Real Madrid.\nNevertheless, a Champions League title and 16 straight league wins cannot be discounted lightly - and victory over Villarreal would be another step forward in Zidane's coaching career, which is so far threatening to be every bit as successful as his playing career.",

I've never seen a Madrid so complete, versatile, and reliable.\"\nThat tribute is also, naturally, an unspoken dig at Barcelona, who are routinely accused of being too reliant upon their Messi-Suarez-Neymar forward line and, when the second-stringers started at home to Alaves 10 days ago, lost 2-1.\nNot many managers could leave out a player for months, recall him to the starting line-up, see him score a record-breaking goal and then hear that player declare the manager \"will always be my idol\".\nBut Zidane was given that endorsement by James Rodriguez after the Colombia international, making his first start of the season, rifled home the opener in Real's hard-earned 2-0 victory at Espanyol on Sunday.\nAnd it's clear that Zidane, a 1998 World Cup winner with France who became a Real legend with a brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final victory over Bayer Leverkusen, is benefitting from the credibility provided by his stellar playing career.\nZidane commands automatic respect - and his aura makes it easier for him to retain good relationships with players he leaves out of the team.\nSo, too, does his constant reassertion of the team ethic and his commitment to squad rotation - it's much easier for dropped players to stay motivated when they know they have a genuine chance of starting next week.\nConsidering his penchant for petulance during his playing days, it is perhaps surprising that another quality which has helped Zidane manage Real's egos is his calm and composed personality.\nWhether on the sidelines, in front of the media or at the training ground, Zidane looks relaxed and always ready to smile, even maintaining his good-humoured patience when asked, as he has been countless times this summer, whether he was intending to sell James.\nIf you ask Barcelona fans whether Zidane is a great manager, they will scoff and say he is a lucky manager.\nWhen asked on social media for his hopes from the Champions League, Barca star Pique ironically replied he would like the kind of campaign enjoyed by Real last season.\n\"Easy group. Third-placed team in Italy in the last 16 [Roma], eighth in Germany in the quarters [Wolfsburg], fourth in England in the semis [Man City]. Return leg always at home,\" Pique tweeted.\nAnd it's true that Real - with all those late winners - have enjoyed some fortune during their record-breaking run, most recently when Sergio Ramos avoided a second yellow card for handball at Espanyol on Sunday by successfully pretending the ball hit his face.\nAlthough the \"lucky\" argument only takes you so far, it's certainly too soon to proclaim Zidane as an unqualified coaching triumph. The season is young and it's never wise to bank on too much stability in the soap opera that is Real Madrid.\nNevertheless, a Champions League title and 16 straight league wins cannot be discounted lightly - and victory over Villarreal would be another step forward in Zidane's coaching career, which is so far threatening to be every bit as successful as his playing career.",

Now we have to get a result against Germany and that is what we are going to do.\n\"We will take even more confidence into the next game. It will be another final but that is what the World Cup is about.\n\"Germany played yesterday and so have more time to recover. We played in the Amazon and they haven't had to travel much. Everything has been made easy for the favourites, whereas we have to struggle to go through, but that is what we will do.\"\nPortugal manager Paulo Bento: \"It's clearly not a good result for us. The 2-2 doesn't put us out of the World Cup mathematically, but it does leave us in a very difficult situation.\n\"Not just because of what we'll need to do against Ghana, but also because we'll need a favourable result from the Germany-United States game.\n\"We were unlucky late in the first half, but it was a great effort to level the match (in second-half stoppage time).\n\"Now all we can do is to give everything in our very last game and try and make the most of the very little chance that we have left.\"",

The four-time champion was a second off the pace, complained of a lack of rear grip and had a spin and a number of moments when he ran wide and off track.\nHe was not the only one to fall prey to the slippery surface at the Hungaroring.\nBoth Haas drivers crashed at the fast Turn 11, Romain Grosjean incurring only light damage, but reserve driver Antonio Giovinazzi bringing out a red flag when he buried his car in the wall, damaging the left-hand side.\nAnd at the end of the session, Renault's Jolyon Palmer lost control at the exit of the fast uphill kink at Turn Four, bouncing over the kerbs and smashing his front wing to pieces.\nPalmer finished the session in an encouraging 10th, just one place and 0.3secs behind team-mate Nico Hulkenberg on a weekend when he is under pressure. Former F1 driver Robert Kubica will test with Renault at this track next week as the team assess whether the Pole is capable of returning to the sport more than six years after a horrific rally crash left him with only partial use of his right arm.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Palmer had damaged the new floor that was introduced for the first time at the last race and which he was using for the first time. Plus, if he had, whether Renault had sufficient spares to fit a new one.\nMcLaren lived up to their promise to perform better than usual in Hungary because of the relative unimportance of engine power at the track, with Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne best of the rest in seventh and eighth places.",

    "source": "The British Film Institute's Sight and Sound magazine polls a selected panel once a decade and Citizen Kane has been its top pick for the last 50 years.\nThis time 846 distributors, critics and academics championed Vertigo, about a retired cop with a fear of heights.\nStarring James Stewart and Kim Novak, Vertigo beat Citizen Kane by 34 votes.\nIn the last poll held 10 years ago, Hitchcock's 1958 thriller came five votes behind Welles's 1941 classic.\nIts triumph coincides with the launch of the BFI's Genius of Hitchcock season, a major retrospective celebrating the acclaimed \"master of suspense\".\nVertigo, the film Hitchcock regarded as his most personal, sees the director tackle obsessional love, one of his recurring themes.\nIt opens with police officer Scotty Ferguson, played by Stewart, retiring after his vertigo inadvertently leads to the death of a colleague.\n1. Vertigo (Hitchcock, 1958)\n2. Citizen Kane (Welles, 1941)\n3. Tokyo Story (Ozu, 1953)\n4. La Regle du Jeu (Renoir, 1939)\n5. Sunrise: a Song for Two Humans (Murnau, 1927)\n6. 2001: A Space Odyssey (Kubrick, 1968)\n7. The Searchers (Ford, 1956)\n8. Man with a Movie Camera (Dziga Vertov, 1929)\n9. The Passion of Joan of Arc (Dreyer, 1927)\n10.  8\u00c2\u00bd (Fellini, 1963)\nHe is then hired by an old friend whose beautiful wife - played by Novak - is behaving strangely.\nAs the story plays out against a San Francisco skyline, there are several revelations that challenge the audience's preconceptions about characters and events.\nThe film is famous for a camera trick Hitchcock invented to represent Scotty's vertigo - a simultaneous zoom-in and pull-back of the camera that creates a disorientating depth of field.\nThe visual, often imitated, has become known as a \"dolly zoom\" or \"trombone shot\".\nLike Citizen Kane, Vertigo received mixed reviews on release but has grown in stature as the years have passed.\nThe Sight and Sound list contains few surprises, with all of the films cited more than 40 years old.\nYasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, from 1953, is ranked third - bettering its 2002 placement at five - while Jean Renoir's La Regle du Jeu (The Rules of the Game) drops one place, from three to four.\nBoth new entries in the Top 10 are silent - Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera at eight, and Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc at nine.\nThe newest film in the Top 10 is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, released in 1968, which charts at six.\nThe top British film in the countdown is The Third Man, which came in at the relatively low placing of number 73.\n1. Tokyo Story (Ozu, 1953)\n2=  2001: A Space Odyssey (Kubrick, 1968)\n2=  Citizen Kane (Welles, 1941)\n4. 8 \u00c2\u00bd (Fellini, 1963)\n5. Taxi Driver (Scorsese, 1976)\n6. Apocalypse Now (Coppola, 1979)\n7=  The Godfather (Coppola, 1972)\n7=  Vertigo (Hitchcock, 1958)\n9. Mirror (Tarkovsky, 1974)\n10. Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948)\nSource: Sight & Sound\nThe panel, which voted for 2,045 films overall, was asked to interpret \"greatest\" how it saw fit.\nIts results, said Sight and Sound editor Nick James, \"reflects changes in the culture of film criticism\".\nVertigo, he continued, was \"the ultimate critics' film\".\n\"It is a dream-like film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate.\"\nIn a separate poll run by the monthly publication involving 358 film directors, Ozu's Tokyo Story was voted the greatest film ever made.\nCitizen Kane is ranked at number two jointly with 2001, while Vertigo occupies seventh place.\nMartin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen and Mike Leigh were among the participants in the poll.\nThe full results are published in Sight and Sound's September issue.",

The whole structure of Fifa must be reviewed and fundamentally changed.\"\nPlatini has found himself at odds with the FA over Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.\nThe 60-year-old championed the Gulf nation despite concerns over its human rights record and severe summer temperatures.\nBut Dyke attempted to play down any differences for the time being, saying: \"Mr Platini has always made it very clear that he voted for Qatar.\n\"If all the other people who voted for Qatar had been quite as transparent it would have been more helpful.\"\nNot everyone shares the FA's confidence in Platini, a former France international who won the coveted Ballon d'Or three times.\nJust hours after confirming his candidacy on Wednesday, he was criticised by two potential presidential rivals.\nPrince Ali and Bility both claim Platini would be a bad choice as a successor.\nPrince Ali, who stood against Blatter in the last presidential election, said that \"football's fans and players deserve better\".\nA member of the Jordanian royal family, he added that Fifa needed a \"new, independent leadership, untainted by the practices of the past\".\nBility agreed, telling the BBC's World Football programme that Platini would bring \"chaos\", \"more division\" and \"more problems\".",

    "source": "\"The most scared I've ever been,\" says Scotland's open-side flanker.\nThe setting is a building in Queenstown on New Zealand's south island -  a holiday resort about an hour and a half from Dipton, the farming country where Hardie was born and reared.\nLegend has it that there was a fire in Lockhart's place in the late 1800s. Three generations of the family perished.\nOnly a girl called Mary survived - and she haunts the place to this day. Many Kiwis have gone there over the years and many talk of the sense of foreboding that exists behind that main door.\nHardie's now one of them. Chilled to the bone, he says. \"Never going back. Never ever.\"\nThe fact that Lockhart's gaff is part of a theme park called Fear Factory - New Zealand's equivalent of the Edinburgh Dungeons - is neither here nor there to Hardie.\nWhen you ask him what's the most tense he has ever been in his life, you don't hear tales of his early years playing for the Southland Stags in Invercargill, or the time he came face-to-face with some assassin in Super Rugby.\nHe mentions the Fear Factory instead. \"I went with my girlfriend about a year ago,\" he said. \"It's pitch dark and you have to follow this red light around these alleyways.\n\"You don't know where you're going then these creatures start jumping out at you. Terrifying. Once was enough.\n\"I don't normally go in for that kind of stuff, but I did a bungee jump once and I'm not doing that again either. Give me a hard game of rugby instead.\"\nAfraid of the dark? It doesn't tally with Hardie's tough persona.\nHardie, 27, is a strange animal - a Scotland international who has never played an international in Scotland, his five caps being won in Turin, Paris, Gloucester, Newcastle and at Twickenham in that epic World Cup quarter-final against Australia.\nA measure of his success since his sudden elevation to the Scotland squad in the summer has been the silencing of the debate surrounding his arrival. One minute, he was a Highlander who wanted to be an All Black and the next a Scot - with a granny from Fife - in the World Cup team.\nHis ascent jarred, but the quality of his game has overtaken everything. He was terrific at the World Cup, his dynamism and cleverness at the breakdown helping to protect and unleash the rapiers in his backline.\n\"It's one of the best things I've done in my life,\" he says of his move from what he calls the \"comfort zone\" of Highlanders rugby. \"Having won a cap, I owed it to Scotland to stay here and playing for Edinburgh has been a really good decision.\n\"I got into too much of a routine in New Zealand and it was good to get out of it. I needed something different in my career - a change in scenery, new players, new coaches.\n\"I love the Highlanders, but it was time to try something else. But it was nerve-racking coming here. It was like going back to school again. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.\"\nHe talks about that day against the Wallabies, but only briefly. \"We had to suck it up.\" That's it?\" No torment, no ghosts?\n\"Nah. We have to learn the lessons, that's all. Nothing else we can do.\"\nNobody should mistake the emotionless matter-of-fact response to a heartbreaking loss as indifference. It's just the Kiwi in him. What's done is done. You move forwards, you don't look backwards.\nWhat about Scotland's habit of losing big games at the death, though? There was that Australia match and the Italy game in the Six Nations just before. There was the France game in the 2014 Six Nations, lost to a penalty two minutes from the end despite France losing eight line-outs and losing the possession and territory battle by a wide margin.\nScottish sides, routinely, come up with novel ways of shooting themselves in the foot.\nMost recently, Glasgow Warriors lost a Champions Cup match to Northampton in the closing minutes, a defeat that put paid to their European hopes, and Hardie's Edinburgh team collapsed close to the finishing line against Grenoble last weekend, a late capitulation which led to them exiting the European Champions Cup.\nYou keep hitting him with this stuff and it doesn't put a dent on him. Zero points scored in the second half against France in the 2015 Six Nations. Another zero in the second half against England and yet another zero against Ireland.\nOnly three points scored in the second half against Italy despite having 61% possession and spending 62% of the second period in the opposition half.\nHe says he doesn't know much about what happened before he arrived on these shores. \"As a kid, I used to watch the Six Nations, but not live,\" he said.\n\"I'd watch it in the morning. I've always known that it was a fantastic thing. But that stuff about what happened in previous seasons doesn't bother me.\n\"I mean, we were points down against Samoa in the World Cup and we won it late on and that was as big a game as any.\n\"I don't think there's a mental barrier.

    "source": "\"The most scared I've ever been,\" says Scotland's open-side flanker.\nThe setting is a building in Queenstown on New Zealand's south island -  a holiday resort about an hour and a half from Dipton, the farming country where Hardie was born and reared.\nLegend has it that there was a fire in Lockhart's place in the late 1800s. Three generations of the family perished.\nOnly a girl called Mary survived - and she haunts the place to this day. Many Kiwis have gone there over the years and many talk of the sense of foreboding that exists behind that main door.\nHardie's now one of them. Chilled to the bone, he says. \"Never going back. Never ever.\"\nThe fact that Lockhart's gaff is part of a theme park called Fear Factory - New Zealand's equivalent of the Edinburgh Dungeons - is neither here nor there to Hardie.\nWhen you ask him what's the most tense he has ever been in his life, you don't hear tales of his early years playing for the Southland Stags in Invercargill, or the time he came face-to-face with some assassin in Super Rugby.\nHe mentions the Fear Factory instead. \"I went with my girlfriend about a year ago,\" he said. \"It's pitch dark and you have to follow this red light around these alleyways.\n\"You don't know where you're going then these creatures start jumping out at you. Terrifying. Once was enough.\n\"I don't normally go in for that kind of stuff, but I did a bungee jump once and I'm not doing that again either. Give me a hard game of rugby instead.\"\nAfraid of the dark? It doesn't tally with Hardie's tough persona.\nHardie, 27, is a strange animal - a Scotland international who has never played an international in Scotland, his five caps being won in Turin, Paris, Gloucester, Newcastle and at Twickenham in that epic World Cup quarter-final against Australia.\nA measure of his success since his sudden elevation to the Scotland squad in the summer has been the silencing of the debate surrounding his arrival. One minute, he was a Highlander who wanted to be an All Black and the next a Scot - with a granny from Fife - in the World Cup team.\nHis ascent jarred, but the quality of his game has overtaken everything. He was terrific at the World Cup, his dynamism and cleverness at the breakdown helping to protect and unleash the rapiers in his backline.\n\"It's one of the best things I've done in my life,\" he says of his move from what he calls the \"comfort zone\" of Highlanders rugby. \"Having won a cap, I owed it to Scotland to stay here and playing for Edinburgh has been a really good decision.\n\"I got into too much of a routine in New Zealand and it was good to get out of it. I needed something different in my career - a change in scenery, new players, new coaches.\n\"I love the Highlanders, but it was time to try something else. But it was nerve-racking coming here. It was like going back to school again. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.\"\nHe talks about that day against the Wallabies, but only briefly. \"We had to suck it up.\" That's it?\" No torment, no ghosts?\n\"Nah. We have to learn the lessons, that's all. Nothing else we can do.\"\nNobody should mistake the emotionless matter-of-fact response to a heartbreaking loss as indifference. It's just the Kiwi in him. What's done is done. You move forwards, you don't look backwards.\nWhat about Scotland's habit of losing big games at the death, though? There was that Australia match and the Italy game in the Six Nations just before. There was the France game in the 2014 Six Nations, lost to a penalty two minutes from the end despite France losing eight line-outs and losing the possession and territory battle by a wide margin.\nScottish sides, routinely, come up with novel ways of shooting themselves in the foot.\nMost recently, Glasgow Warriors lost a Champions Cup match to Northampton in the closing minutes, a defeat that put paid to their European hopes, and Hardie's Edinburgh team collapsed close to the finishing line against Grenoble last weekend, a late capitulation which led to them exiting the European Champions Cup.\nYou keep hitting him with this stuff and it doesn't put a dent on him. Zero points scored in the second half against France in the 2015 Six Nations. Another zero in the second half against England and yet another zero against Ireland.\nOnly three points scored in the second half against Italy despite having 61% possession and spending 62% of the second period in the opposition half.\nHe says he doesn't know much about what happened before he arrived on these shores. \"As a kid, I used to watch the Six Nations, but not live,\" he said.\n\"I'd watch it in the morning. I've always known that it was a fantastic thing. But that stuff about what happened in previous seasons doesn't bother me.\n\"I mean, we were points down against Samoa in the World Cup and we won it late on and that was as big a game as any.\n\"I don't think there's a mental barrier. I'm new to it all, but I can't sense anything like that.\n\"I don't see any fear, there's no blockage. We scored lots of tries at the World Cup. Lots of line-breaks. I think there's a lot of improvement.\"\nHis knowledge of the Calcutta Cup is from across the other side of the world. He's never played in it, watched it in the flesh, or even watched it live on television. There's a hurricane coming his way on 6 February and he knows it.\n\"The boys have told me about it, but I know that Scotland v England is massive, it's one of the great fixtures,\" he said. \"I'm not a great watcher of other teams, but there's a lot of change going on with England. New coach, lots of new players, lots of excitement.

    "source": "But the message may take some time to reach India.\nThe country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs.\nAnd deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights.\nIndia is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\n'Second-class' citizens\nEven before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village.\nSeveral athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches.\nTaking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said.\nThe channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit.\nIt's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves.\nIndia may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\nSpeaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians.\nHe said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India.\n\"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said.\nThere is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete.\nWhile officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper.\nMost schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\nWhile stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed.\nHe hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others.\nHis training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training.\nToday the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement and change the attitude of people towards disabled in India.\nBBC Monitoringreports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

    "source": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign.\nHere, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs.\n1. The US should use waterboarding\nThis and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice.\n2. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\"\nMr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\".  BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn.\n3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\".\nHe's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\".\n4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11\nDonald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim.\n5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\".\nMr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks.\n6. Climate change is just \"weather\"\nWhile Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\"\n7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power\nMr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists.\n8. Illegal migrants should be deported\nTrump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation.\n9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\"\nHe says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees.\n10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\"\nHe has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him.\n11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone\nTrump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate.\n12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\"\nMr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class.\n13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues\nHe has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking.\n14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\"\nMr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers.\n15. He's worth $10bn\nBased on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn.\n16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul\nMr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans.\n17. Lobbyists should be more restricted\nMr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\n18. He is a \"really nice guy\"\nIn Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post.\n19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman\nA video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\"\n20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals\nHe has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\".\n21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\"\nWhy? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance.\n22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions\nOr should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead.\n23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\"\nHe called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him.\n24. The federal minimum wage should be raised\nWorkers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",

You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",

    "source": "I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation.\nHe is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web.\nTo some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet.\nTo others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted.\nDingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue.\nDingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\nThe Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\n\"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\"\nIn layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor].\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties.\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in.\nIn 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month.\n\"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\n\"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\"\nThe ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online.\nBut given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\n\"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says.\n___________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370",

    "source": "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support.\nBut some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day.\nHere, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever.\nBy Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News.\nThe Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies.\nIt was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979.\nThe number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister.\nSince the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants.\nThe sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there.\nWhen Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock.\nCritics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply.\nThe Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again.\nBy Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News\nBefore Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country.\nThe page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls.\nThe Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to \u00a31,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to \u00a3100,000.\nOn the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p.\nBut Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax.\nTo fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%.\nWithin a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%.\nBy Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor\nWith money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed.\nRestrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s.\nAnd, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window.\nBuilding societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete.\nThe Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years.\nMrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988.\nThe new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired.\nThe promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions.\nCompensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn.\nMore successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break.\nTo complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa.\nThe idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away.\nBy John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News\nFew senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement.\nShe was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike.\nThe Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job.\nSecret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day.\nIn 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million.\nThe miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police.\nIn the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever.\nUnions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions.\nOne of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged.\nBy Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News\nA policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics.\nThe recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership.\nBy the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later.\nThis led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK.\nOne of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986.\nThe promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices.\nAnyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid.\nPrivatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing.\nIt also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies.\nYet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s.\nIn 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010.\nBy Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News\nThe impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK.\nThe so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face.\nBig Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading.\nIt also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.)\nBefore Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor.\nPrice competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm.\nAt best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping.\nBig Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops.\nThis, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses.\nBig Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares.\nBut while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty.\n\"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\"\nFleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne.\n\"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said.\n\"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

    "source": "New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before.\nSavings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis.\nSince last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again.\nTax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points.\nIn research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year.\nWhile low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills.\n\"There's no light at the end of the tunnel,\" says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings.\n\"Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore.

They have systematically dropped the services from this town.\"\nMr Reece described BCUHB's plans as a new version of old proposals by the Flintshire Health Board which had already been rejected by the Welsh government.\nExplaining the reasons behind its proposed shake-up, BCUHB said it was clear that it could not afford to stand still.\n\"The status quo is not an option,\" the board said.\n\"The proposals we are now making are intended to change the way in which services are provided and where they are provided to ensure patient safety and meet quality standards.\n\"The proposals will allow us to attract and retain the professional clinical staff we need and control our costs when public finances are decreasing.\"\nBCUHB said its consultation exercise would run until 28 October, and it would also take account of the views of the community health council and any views they have heard from the public before making decisions.\nAny changes would start in early 2013, it said.",

    "source": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.\nPrime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\"\nBut now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.\nThe big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.\nHe has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.\nWhen he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.\nThe hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\nHe swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.\nGiven the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.\nBut crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.\nAlthough lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.\nIn 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.\nThe following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.\nHe created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\".\nLater he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\".\nThe London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.\nThe son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.\nAt Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.\nIn his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.\nHis decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.\nDays after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.\nAlthough suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.\nHe was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.\nMr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.\nIn 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.\nMr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.\nHis latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.",

HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes.\"\nIn a statement, Next said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC \"some years ago\" and that this had been fully accounted for at the time.\nThe retailer described the dispute between itself and HMRC as \"a technical debate around complex legislation\" which had now been superseded. It added that current UK law generally allowed companies to \"repatriate their profits without a tax charge\".",

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nThe Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\nIsrael rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.\nMr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.\nThe Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.\nBut on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.\nMr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.\n\"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said.\n\"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\"\nMr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January.\n\"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

    "source": "Earlier in the morning we saw a number of airstrikes in the Old City. Iraqi forces were still pinned down by snipers from the group that calls itself Islamic State.\nColonel Jabbar Abad told us it was the last pocket of resistance. He claimed they would be defeated within hours.\nHis troops helped a steady stream of civilians fleeing to safety. Mostly women and children. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped.\nThe children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless.\nThe families were given food and water. This, their first taste of freedom after three years of living under IS control. The battle briefly forgotten in their own fight for survival.\nIf this is victory it has come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had to leave dead relatives behind.\nAlmost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed.\nSearch and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses.\nWe met Ali, who had come to find his brother's family. Hoping against hope that some may have survived.\nHe said IS fighters had been using their house when it was hit by a coalition airstrike a few weeks ago. Iraqi security forces had only recently taken the area.\nWith tears streaming down his face, Ali held up his mobile phone and told me he'd spoken to his brother trapped under the rubble. But over the last few days there had been no reply.\nAli helped the search and rescue teams make their way through the tonnes of rubble.\nThey tried to console him when all they could find what must have been their remains, which they carried off in a black zipped bag. We watched them do the same at several other sites.\nContrast that with the jubilation of the Iraqi security forces who mobbed Prime Minister Abadi as he arrived in the city to declare victory over IS.\nThis is still a significant moment. The extremists have held the city for three years. It's taken nine months of brutal street to street fighting to dislodge them.\nThis was their stronghold in Iraq. It was here, in the city's now flattened Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his one and only public appearance as Caliph of their so-called state.\nFor many IS fighters Mosul is their graveyard, though it is still likely that some have escaped.\nThe misery of Mosul is far from over. The UN estimates it will cost at least $1bn (\u00a30.77bn) to restore the city's basic infrastructure - such as clean water and electricity.\nIt will take tens of billions more to rebuild this city.",

    "source": "Batsman Root is the favourite to take over from Alastair Cook, who stepped down on Monday after a record 59 Tests.\nThe Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015.\n\"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show.\nShould he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012.\nNo batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket.\nAnderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003.\nThe 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007.\n\"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson.\n\"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhile they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes.\nRoot scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals.\n\"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said.\n\"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good.\n\"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\"\nRoot has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended.\nHe was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year.\nAll-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood.\n\"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show.\n\"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\"\nFast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness.\n\"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\"\nWicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate.\nHowever, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series.\nEx-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting.\n\"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said.\nHowever, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries.\nSmith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations.\n\"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander.\n\"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one.\n\"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\"\nEngland and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy.\nThe pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14.\n\"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme.\n\"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him.\n\"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.\nAfter Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.\nThousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.\nThere are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.\nThe 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.\nPeople will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.\nThe actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.\nAn individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.\nGovernment guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.\nNew 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.\nA new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.\nThey can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",

    "source": "More than 60 years on, with another World Cup looming in Brazil and the Indian economy booming, there are renewed hopes that football can finally gain a toehold in the cricket-loving country.\nQualification for the 2014 World Cup may be a step too far, but there are a number of initiatives under way to boost the sport.\nThe challenges are to nurture that growing interest while wooing fans away from watching overseas football on TV,  and the need to create a strong national league and international team.\nOff the pitch there is the need to build football industry and infrastructure, while boosting the expertise of administrators and coaching and other backroom staff.\n\"There is a challenge from cricket, which gets the most investment,\" admits Kushal Das, general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).\n\"Many youngsters though are now watching a lot of football, mainly European leagues.\n\"We need to develop interest in the Indian leagues, and we need development programmes for that.\"\nMr Das said he was encouraged by the recent visit of Fifa president Sepp Blatter to the country.\nThe country is hoping to host the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, and Mr Blatter has so far offered encouraging noises.\nMr Das said that highlights over the past couple of years included India playing in the AFC Asian Cup in 2011 for the first time in more than 20 years, and the 15-year commercial and marketing partnership between the AIFF and IMG-Reliance.\nEncouragement has also come from a recent development plan for football in India drawn up with Fifa.\n\"We are starting up academies for player development in four cities by July and another four by July 2013, for different age groups,\" says Mr Das.\nA technical director has also been appointed for the first time, unusual as it may seem that such a role did not exist before.\n\"We are looking not just at player development, but also administration, education, referees,\" says Mr Das.\n\"If we are successful in hosting the Under-17 there will be [business] opportunities, to participate in the whole development of Indian football - it is a great opportunity.\"\nHe adds: \"The biggest challenge is infrastructure. I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\"\nIMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017.\nOne of the footballing hotbeds in the country is Pune, a city in the west of the country with a three million-plus population.\n\"Sport, including football, is tremendously popular among the youth of our city today,\" says Vishwajeet Kadam,  president of Pune District Football Association.\n\"We don't only focus on the skills development of players. We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\"\nPune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city.\n\"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam.\n\"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market.\n\"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\"\nOne club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children.\nMario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days.\n\"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support.\n\"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\"\nBusiness bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football.\nRajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise.\n\"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure.\n\"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football.\n\"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\"\nIMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF.\n\"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack.\nMr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\".\nHe adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from an??? organisation standpoint.\n\"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work.\n\"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand. Football needs to succeed. It needs a plan. We are are not there yet.\n\"But the long term view we have is that this will be lucrative.\"\nMeanwhile, uncertainty remains about the future of the proposed, but currently delayed, Premier Soccer League (PLS) in West Bengal.\nThe PLS was intended as a state league for older European players - such as Robert Pires and Fabio Cannavaro. It attracted publicity around the world, particularly in the UK.\nMr Slack said he understood the premise of the league as, he says, India is a country that is \"star driven\".\nBut he said there was a pressing need to boost the status of the current Indian national soccer league.\n\"We are in dialogue with I-League about how to make the league more competitive and attractive,\" he says.\n\"There are no easy solutions there. We completely understand that the clubs need to get more out of it.\"",

Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care.\nThe first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday.\nThe discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek.\nThe three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found.\nQuoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street.\nIt is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves.\nA spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable.\nThe chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack.\nThe computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode.\nIn his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore.\nCopies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US.\nBrussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed.\nA temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity,\nChief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt \"from the air conditioning to the check-in desks\".\nSeveral airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing \u20ac5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport.\nIn a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough.\nThey complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's \"open infrastructure\" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.",

I always wanted to be nominated for this award, but I didn't think to myself that I'd win it. I always made a joke about it!\"\nThe musician's debut album is a searingly-personal collection of piano-based songs, which critics have called \"bold\", \"brilliant\" and \"astonishing\".\nIt touches on his turbulent upbringing in Edmonton, London, as well as the three years he spent sleeping rough in Paris.\n\"I made this album thinking only about 50 people would listen to it,\" he told the BBC. \"My music isn't mainstream music.\n\"It goes to show that you've just got to be sincere in your work and people will listen to it.\"\nThe Mercury Prize recognises innovative albums produced in the UK and Ireland.

It could be anybody's.\"\nA panel of 12 musicians, broadcasters and music writers selected the winner, casting their final votes on the night of the award ceremony.\nThe jury included former nominee Corinne Bailey Rae, who said the decision came \"really close to the wire\".\nThe judges began their deliberations with a longlist of 298 albums earlier this year, which was whittled down to a shortlist of 12, announced in October.\nThey were:\nRead more on the shortlisted acts\nNewcomer Eska, whose self-titled album is an unusual combination of soul, psychedelia and jazz, said there were \"12 winners\" on the night, with newcomers and established artists sharing the limelight equally.\n\"There's no winning to be had, apart from a pocket full of money,\" she added. \"A very big pocket full of money!\"\nScottish composer C Duncan agreed that simply being shortlisted had changed his career.\n\"It was one of those albums that completely slipped under the radar,\" he said of his debut record, Architect. \"But since it was nominated for the Mercury, so many more people have listened to it and discovered it, which is nice.\"",

Records are made to be broken.''\nEarlier this month, Kelly broke the U.S. record for the most time in space: 383 days and counting over four missions.

The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing.\nUsers can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK.\nThere is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video.\nThe spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\"\nHowever, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\".\n\"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy.\n\"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".\nSue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\".\nShe said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\".\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\"\n\"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

Man of Iron won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1981.\nWajda once said that \"the good Lord gave the director two eyes - one to look into the camera, the other to be alert to everything that is going on around him.\"\nWajda was born in 1926 in the north-eastern Polish town of Suwalki.\nHis father was among the victims of the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers by the Soviet Union in 1940.\nWajda tried to follow in his father's footsteps, but was rejected by a military academy, and joined the Polish resistance in World War Two.\nDuring World War Two, Wajda joined the Polish resistance. He later studied to be a painter, before entering the Lodz Film School.\nIn 1955, he made his feature film debut with Generation, set during the German occupation of Warsaw in World War Two.  It was followed by Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds, which form a trilogy about life in wartime Poland.\nSome of his films found disfavour with the communist rulers of Poland because of their trenchant portraits of the wartime Warsaw Uprising and the suppression of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s.\nIt was only after the fall of communism in 1989 that he was able to make his film about Katyn.\n\"I never thought I would live to see the moment when Poland would be a free country,\" Wajda said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press.\n\"I thought I would die in that system.

    "source": "In a series of Twitter posts addressed directly to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro also called him a \"petty dictator\".\nMr Maduro accused the OAS chief earlier this week of being a CIA agent and a traitor himself.\nThe Venezuelan president has blamed his country's economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co-ordinated from the US.\nDuring a three-hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified his declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA.\nHe then told journalists: \"Almagro, just give up. He has been a traitor for a long time... At some point I will tell his story, I know his secrets. The Americans, the CIA, have played a master move using Almagro as their agent.\"\nMr Almagro, who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay, had already clashed with Mr Maduro last year after he called him \"rubbish\".\nMr Almagro had responded on that occasion with an eight-page open letter, saying he would be \"rubbish\" if he ignored the plight of the Venezuelan people.\nHis Twitter posts this week were both more concise and more direct.\nLinking to his open letter to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro said: @NicolasMaduro I'm not a traitor either to my ideas or my principles BUT YOU ARE A TRAITOR to your people.\nIn a series of 12 tweets, he also told the Venezuelan president that \"you will NEVER be able to undo so much suffering, intimidation, misery and anguish you've created for your people\".\nHe also said Mr Maduro would \"NEVER be able to bring back to life the children who've died because of lack of medicine\".\nVenezuelan doctors say a shortage of essential medicine has reached a crisis point.\nMr Almagro also urged Mr Maduro to allow a recall referendum to go ahead.\nOpposition politicians have handed in a petition with 1.85 million signatures to the electoral authorities requesting a referendum be held to recall Mr Maduro from office.\nBut Mr Maduro's deputy, Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were \"fraudulent\".\nMr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro \"another petty dictator\".\nWhile President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro's tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did.\nShe wrote, \"Mr Almagro, every time you make a statement you express your hatred against Venezuela and its legitimate authorities. You are part of the imperialist detritus.\"\n\"You only repeat the scripted words which your imperialist masters dictate to you\".\n\"You will never give orders to Venezuela!\"\nThe former president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, has also commented on the row between Mr Almagro, who served as Mr Mujica's foreign minister, and President Maduro.\nAsked what he made of the bitter exchange, he said using a popular Spanish saying that Mr Maduro was \"crazy as a goat\".\n\"They're all crazy in Venezuela, they call each other all sorts of things but they're not going to fix anything this way.\"\nWhile Mr Mujica is known for his direct and outspoken manner his words are damaging to Mr Maduro, who has always praised the former left-wing president as a \"comrade\".",

    "source": "The plastic moulded figures, rebranded from the US GI Joe version, made their debut in the UK at the British Toy Fair in Brighton, in January 1966, after a toy executive realised their market potential.\nThe early toys were imports but Palitoy, based in Coalville, Leicestershire, would go on to make its own version with \"lifelike hair\", \"beards\" and \"gripping hands\" in the early 1970s.\nAccording to Rob Burman, editor of the Collectors Gazette, Palitoy bosses gave strict instructions not to call them \"dolls\" as boys could be put off.\nThey were hugely popular, with sales topping 20 million by the end of the 1970s.\nModifications kept the toys fresh and collectable, for example \"eagle eyes\" were introduced in 1976 by Hasbro, the US makers, and Palitoy brought in \"flocked\" hair and non-military costumes such as football kits.\nHowever, despite a loyal band of collectors, the success did not last into the 1980s.\n\"The 60s and 70s were the big times for Action Man and then Star Wars came along,\" said Mr Burman.\n\"Everyone wanted intergalactic characters, they weren't bothered about poor old Action Man.\"\nThe toy expert said the figure made a bit of a comeback in the 1990s but nowadays people are generally more \"politically correct\" and so there is little interest in soldier toys.\nHowever, there is still a thirst for the old outfits - a boxed judo costume recently sold for ??6,000 at auction.\nChris Malbon, 58, from Nottingham, who runs Warwickshire-based Metropolis Toys, had at one time one of the most \"comprehensive\" Action Man collections in the UK.\nHe started collecting in 1989 and spent thousands on his acquisitions, which he admits got a \"bit out of hand\", and he later he sold them all for a \"substantial\" fee.\n\"I collected the entire range,\" said the trader. \"Both boxed and loose, together with US, French, German, Spanish, Japanese variations. I guess around 200 figures.\"\nHowever, it all became a bit of a burden.\nHe said: \"It's not because of the money... you end up wanting that elusive item or upgrading what you have to the exclusion of other things.\"\nMr Malbon, a former soldier himself, did not want to say what he sold his collection for but said it was as much as he paid for his house in the 1990s.\nPalitoy's former chief toy designer Bob Brechin, who modelled Action Man's gripping hands on his own, said the toy has endured.\n\"It's hard to believe it has been 50 years,\" he said.\n\"He's timeless, universal, we never gave Action Man a story, we just gave children [the figures] and the outfits you dress him in and left it to their imaginations.\"\nHasbro has announced it is releasing a set of vintage figures as part of the anniversary celebrations.\nIt seems Action Man is not quite ready to leave the battlefield.",

Typically sound in possession but not as influential as he has been earlier in the tournament.\nShowed imagination with a low corner which led to a chance for Gareth Bale but had only limited influence in open play before being replaced by Sam Vokes shortly after Portugal's second goal.\nMade some characteristic runs into the Portugal penalty area but could not make the crucial connections. Forced deeper as Portugal's midfield gained control in the second half, the Leicester Premier League winner had to curb his attacking instincts.\nTrademark runs from deep and at a startling pace had Portugal's defenders backtracking in the first half but his influence waned in the second period. The Real Madrid forward's audacious long-range shot was Wales' last effort.\nBrimming with confidence following his stunning goal in the quarter-final win over Belgium, the free agent stretched Portugal's defence with his powerful running. He was starved of the ball in the second half, however, as the match wore on.\nBrought on shortly after Wales fell 2-0 behind, the Burnley striker failed to connect meaningfully with any of the crosses which came his way.\nDid not see much of the ball and, when he did, was not in a position to cause Portugal any problems.\nTried making his usual probing runs between the opponents' midfield and defence but found himself crowded out.",

I promise everybody we will use it and come back stronger.\"\nLiverpool were on course to secure Champions League football - on offer to the winners of the competition this year - when Daniel Sturridge's magnificent strike with the outside of his left foot gave them the interval lead.\nBut the Reds conceded three goals in the space of 24 second-half minutes - Kevin Gameiro netting 17 seconds after the interval, before Coke struck twice.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"There is no criticism and I have spoken to my players,\" added Klopp.\n\"What I think about not being in the Champions League is that we have to use the time.\n\"It is not about the size of the squad, it is about using the time in training to get better.\"\nFormer Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson was frustrated by the Reds' second-half collapse.\n\"Experience was key after conceding,\" said the 1984 European Cup winner, who was part of BBC Radio 5 live's team in Basel.\n\"Where was the central defender or captain saying 'circle the wagons for 20 minutes - we do not concede and we get ourselves back into game'? That is something Liverpool just didn't do.\n\"They had one stonewall penalty in the first half but when you go in 1-0 up at half-time in a cup final, what is the first thing anyone says in the dressing room?\n\"You make sure you don't concede in the first 10 or 20 minutes. What did Liverpool do? They conceded in the first 17 seconds.\"\nLeft-back Alberto Moreno was at fault for Sevilla's first goal, and Lawrenson was also critical of the 23-year-old's performance.\n\"Yet again Moreno, who used to play for Sevilla, has made a massive mistake,\" he said.\n\"I've lost count of how many mistakes this guy has made.\n\"It's all very good pouring forward but the clue is in the title - left-back. Try defending occasionally. Moreno has made mistakes all season - basic errors.\n\"Where was he for Villarreal's goal the other week? He was trying to score a goal at the other end.\"\nLawrenson said former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked in October, had to share the blame for not strengthening the left-back area during his tenure.\nHe added: \"Liverpool didn't have, by the end of August, another player who could play left-back unless they moved Nathaniel Clyne from the right.\n\"Jose Enrique was never going to play. I'm sorry, Brendan Rodgers gets the blame for me.\"\nLawrenson expects a summer of change at Anfield, but expects Sturridge and Brazilian duo Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho to stay.\n\"I'd imagine Liverpool have spoken to agents and will have an indication of whether players are coming,\" he said.\n\"If you are in a room with Klopp then I'd think it was hard to say no to him. This summer's transfer window is going to be the biggest ever in the Premier League in terms of money spent.\n\"Firmino, Coutinho and Sturridge are not going anywhere this summer - other than on holiday.\n\"Klopp knew within two weeks of taking over he needed to bring in players.\n\"Why didn't he address it in January? He probably did but could not get the right personnel in.\"",

We're going to work up a system which is fairer.\"\nHe has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities.\nAnd with a hand out to Derby, he says: \"If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them.\"\nIt's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go.\nCouncils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead.\nHow they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.",

    "source": "Dear President Tusk\nOn 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\nEarlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.\nToday, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.\nSee the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF)\nThis letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.\nIt is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.\nI would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.\nAs I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \"acquis\") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.\nFrom the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\nThe United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\nIf, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.\nIt is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.\nLooking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.\ni. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no \"cherry picking\". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets.\nii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights.\niii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\niv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process.\nv. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.\nvi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.\nvii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.\nAs I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May",

With Fifa, or the people who had no choice but to get the World Cup with bribing?\"\nIn response, Fifa said in a statement on Monday: \"Fifa initiated the investigation by the Swiss authorities precisely to answer questions such as this.\n\"However, while investigations are ongoing, it should be noted that to date, no evidence has come to light to suggest there are any legal grounds for rescinding the current Fifa World Cup selections.\"\nSeven senior Fifa officials were arrested last month in high-profile dawn raids at a Zurich hotel, where they had been staying before the presidential election.\nThey are among 14 people charged by US prosecutors, who allege that bribes and kickbacks of more than $150m (\u00a3100m) were accepted over a 24-year period.\nBlatter, Fifa president since 1998, was re-elected at the Zurich meeting but announced four days later that he would resign amid the corruption allegations engulfing the organisation.\nAmerican lawyer Michael Garcia was previously hired by Fifa to investigate the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes, but he complained that the published summary of his 430-page report was an \"erroneous\" representation of his work.\nThe report cleared World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar of wrongdoing.\nGarcia quit weeks later over Fifa's handling of his inquiry and his comments reopened the debate about the validity of the bidding process.\nScala has since had Garcia's report reviewed by legal experts, from both in and outside of sport, but neither were able to find grounds to alter the award of either tournament at this stage.",

Flint was successfully rehomed after an appeal.\nAnother case saw a litter of eight abandoned puppies found in a bin in Queensferry, Deeside, in March 2015. Some still had their umbilical cord attached. They were eventually found new homes.\nAssistant external relations director Claire Lawson said: \"Although 2015 was another very busy year for the RSPCA in Wales, progress continued in the fight to reduce cruelty and alleviate suffering.\n\"There was a fall in the number of cruelty complaints and prosecutions, but a rise in the number of welfare and warning notices we successfully implemented and so we know our education and advice is working.\"",

    "source": "It is a talent that helped him move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time he was 48.\nAlong the way he created and sold best-selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high-profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco.\nNow 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on his farm, the serial entrepreneur says: \"People love stories, the real stories behind things.\n\"And the media was very important to me from the first days of Tyrrells.\n\"I was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\"\nThe son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from his dad when he was 20 after he \"managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend me \u00a3200,000\".\nAs the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant he couldn't harvest his crop, which he had to leave to rot in the fields.\nOverextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\"\nAfter \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again.\nThis time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets.\nYet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\".\nHe adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\"\nMr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle.\nAt the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand.\nDespite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand.\nSo he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado.\nReturning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later.\nQuick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps.\nHe says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for \u00a31 and they would retail them for \u00a32. For us the net profit was 35%.\"\nSupermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices.\nThen one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price.\nAn incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down.\nWith sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting \u00a314m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business.\nMr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment.\n\"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\"\nUnhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost \u00a340m.\nLooking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka.\nSo with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born.\nAimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for \u00a335 a bottle.\nWhile Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales.\nAnd showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made.\nAlso now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week.\nMr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand. But there has to be real DNA behind it if you want to be successful.\"",

He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\"\nAfter \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again.\nThis time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets.\nYet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\".\nHe adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\"\nMr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle.\nAt the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand.\nDespite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand.\nSo he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado.\nReturning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later.\nQuick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps.\nHe says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for \u00a31 and they would retail them for \u00a32. For us the net profit was 35%.\"\nSupermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices.\nThen one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price.\nAn incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down.\nWith sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting \u00a314m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production.

And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales.\nAnd showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made.\nAlso now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week.\nMr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand.

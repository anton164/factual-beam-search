    "source": "I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation.\nHe is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web.\nTo some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet.\nTo others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted.\nDingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue.\nDingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\nThe Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\n\"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\"\nIn layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor].\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties.\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in.\nIn 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month.\n\"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\n\"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\"\nThe ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online.\nBut given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\n\"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says.\n___________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370",

    "source": "Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support.\nBut some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day.\nHere, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever.\nBy Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News.\nThe Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies.\nIt was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979.\nThe number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister.\nSince the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants.\nThe sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there.\nWhen Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock.\nCritics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply.\nThe Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again.\nBy Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News\nBefore Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country.\nThe page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls.\nThe Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to \u00a31,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to \u00a3100,000.\nOn the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p.\nBut Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax.\nTo fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%.\nWithin a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%.\nBy Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor\nWith money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the \"feelgood factor\". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed.\nRestrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s.\nAnd, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window.\nBuilding societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete.\nThe Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years.\nMrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988.\nThe new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired.\nThe promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions.\nCompensating the victims cost the pensions industry \u00a311bn.\nMore successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to \u00a36,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break.\nTo complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa.\nThe idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have \u00a3390bn salted away.\nBy John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News\nFew senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement.\nShe was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike.\nThe Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job.\nSecret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day.\nIn 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million.\nThe miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police.\nIn the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever.\nUnions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions.\nOne of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged.\nBy Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News\nA policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics.\nThe recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership.\nBy the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later.\nThis led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK.\nOne of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986.\nThe promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to \"tell Sid\" about the chance to buy shares at \"affordable\" prices.\nAnyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid.\nPrivatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing.\nIt also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies.\nYet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s.\nIn 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010.\nBy Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News\nThe impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK.\nThe so-called \"Big Bang\", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face.\nBig Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading.\nIt also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.)\nBefore Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor.\nPrice competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm.\nAt best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping.\nBig Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops.\nThis, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses.\nBig Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares.\nBut while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.",

I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty.\n\"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\"\nFleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne.\n\"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said.\n\"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

    "source": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.\nPrime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\"\nBut now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.\nThe big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.\nHe has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.\nWhen he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.\nThe hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\nHe swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.\nGiven the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.\nBut crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.\nAlthough lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.\nIn 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.\nThe following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.\nHe created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\".\nLater he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\".\nThe London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.\nThe son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.\nAt Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.\nIn his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.\nHis decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.\nDays after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.\nAlthough suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.\nHe was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.\nMr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.\nIn 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.\nMr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.\nHis latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.",

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nThe Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\nIsrael rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.\nMr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.\nThe Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.\nBut on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.\nMr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.\n\"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said.\n\"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\"\nMr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January.\n\"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.",

    "source": "Batsman Root is the favourite to take over from Alastair Cook, who stepped down on Monday after a record 59 Tests.\nThe Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015.\n\"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show.\nShould he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012.\nNo batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket.\nAnderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003.\nThe 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007.\n\"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson.\n\"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWhile they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes.\nRoot scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals.\n\"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said.\n\"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -  for bathroom breaks -  Root's been in there making changes. He's been good.\n\"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\"\nRoot has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended.\nHe was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year.\nAll-rounder Ben Stokes, who was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh which regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan missed, was described as a \"natural leader\" by his Durham skipper Paul Collingwood.\n\"Ben has got a natural draw to him and he would be an excellent vice-captain for Root,\" former England limited-overs captain Collingwood said on the Tuffers and Vaughan show.\n\"The captain will have leaders underneath him that he knows he can go to - I think Ben Stokes would be the perfect man for that.\"\nFast bowler Stuart Broad has also been mooted - he captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 - and Anderson said: \"I wouldn't be against a fast bowler but one issue could be fitness.\n\"Bowlers get injured a lot more so are they going to play every game? The international schedule is hectic so it can be difficult.\"\nWicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who led the one-day side in Bangladesh in Morgan's absence and remains the official limited-overs vice-captain, has also been suggested as a possible candidate.\nHowever, the Lancashire player's Test place is not guaranteed given current keeper Jonny Bairstow's good form - although Buttler played as a specialist batsman in the last three Tests of the recent India series.\nEx-England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Radio 5 live he felt the pressure of potential Test captaincy was already affecting Root's batting.\n\"I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced, which he would be without the burden of being the captain,\" he said.\nHowever, Kohli, along with Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, have each raised their games since becoming captains of their respective countries.\nSmith and Kohli are the two top-ranked Test batsmen, while Williamson is one of 13 men to have scored a Test century against all of the other nine Test-playing nations.\n\"It's very English to assume the captaincy will affect him. The other three have got captaincy of their country and gone to a different level with it,\" said ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan, who came through the same Sheffield Collegiate club side and Yorkshire academy ranks which produced Root, and has been a long-term mentor to the young right-hander.\n\"I don't think there's an issue with him captaining, he's too good a player. I think he'd be a good one.\n\"To captain any team you have to be loving the game, love the difficult moments and prove people wrong. He is that kind of character.\"\nEngland and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was named captain of the county in December 2016, said that his team-mate Root's inexperience was not an issue in him assuming the captaincy.\nThe pair lived together in 2011 during their early years in the Yorkshire first team and Ballance took Root's place when he was dropped for the final Test of England's Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14.\n\"I think both of us have probably matured a bit more as cricketers and people. He's ready as a leader now in that England changing room,\" Ballance told BBC World Service's Stumped programme.\n\"I think Rooty's a natural born leader. He's done it from a young age. People follow him.\n\"He speaks well, he's got a great cricket brain. I don't think inexperience is too much of a problem. He'll be ready if he gets the opportunity.\"",

I hope, if we have the World Cup hosting rights, that there will be serious efforts to improve the infrastructure.\"\nIMG and stadium builders Populous have already been around the country looking at which existing stadiums could potentially be brought up to scratch for 2017.\nOne of the footballing hotbeds in the country is Pune, a city in the west of the country with a three million-plus population.\n\"Sport, including football, is tremendously popular among the youth of our city today,\" says Vishwajeet Kadam,  president of Pune District Football Association.\n\"We don't only focus on the skills development of players. We also taking to the FA and taking advice from the Indian Premier League cricket, and hockey, about ways to boost the football industry and surrounding football industry skills.\"\nPune also has contacts with English Premier League football clubs, including Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, who both have training academies in the city.\n\"Other clubs have been to India to just hold training sessions, but Liverpool has shown a clear commitment,\" says Mr Kadam.\n\"Most European clubs seriously underestimate the Indian market.\n\"There are organisations in India ready to spend money in partnerships with European clubs.\"\nOne club which has formed a partnership is Italian side Inter Milan, which has entered a joint football venture with Tata Tea to support a youth football tournament in India, covering 15 cities, 1,000 schools, and one million children.\nMario de Vivo, Inter Milan chief commercial officer, adds: \"We then select 16 young Indian pupils and take them to Inter Milan training academy for three days.\n\"We are bringing to India not only technical skills, but also medical, nutritional, and psychological support.\n\"We are able to offer a complete platform to help young teams, federations, and other people that want to learn about football and improve the professional side.\"\nBusiness bodies in India also wants to improve transparency, accountability, marketing, planning and professionalism in football.\nRajpal Singh of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) says: \"We realise in sport we need foreign expertise.\n\"We want to create a sporting culture in India, and bring about attitudinal change and develop a sporting infrastructure.\n\"India is a cricket country but over the past two years you can see a change in attitude. Sports people are now looking towards football.\n\"But we need to examine the whole football infrastructure.\"\nIMG-Reliance is bringing its sports industry expertise to India as part of its deal with the AIFF.\n\"Indians love football and can play football. If you buy into that premise then you know we will be successful,\" says IMG's Jefferson Slack.\nMr Slack admits there are challenges on the football and infrastructure side, but says there is a competitive media market in India that is \"going to need high quality football content\".\nHe adds: \"There are certainly some challenges. The existing league suffers from an??? organisation standpoint.\n\"The IPL [cricket] was instructive because it showed that a properly constructed franchise league could work.\n\"There is a lot of money in India to build a brand. Football needs to succeed. It needs a plan. We are are not there yet.\n\"But the long term view we have is that this will be lucrative.\"\nMeanwhile, uncertainty remains about the future of the proposed, but currently delayed, Premier Soccer League (PLS) in West Bengal.\nThe PLS was intended as a state league for older European players - such as Robert Pires and Fabio Cannavaro. It attracted publicity around the world, particularly in the UK.\nMr Slack said he understood the premise of the league as, he says, India is a country that is \"star driven\".\nBut he said there was a pressing need to boost the status of the current Indian national soccer league.\n\"We are in dialogue with I-League about how to make the league more competitive and attractive,\" he says.\n\"There are no easy solutions there. We completely understand that the clubs need to get more out of it.\"",

The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing.\nUsers can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK.\nThere is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video.\nThe spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\"\nHowever, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\".\n\"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy.\n\"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".\nSue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\".\nShe said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\".\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\"\n\"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

The CIA stressed that none of the documents released so far were classified.\n\"In fact, they appear to be documents that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess,\" a statement said.\nHigh-profile leaks including a wealth of diplomatic cables from Wikileaks have dogged the US government in recent years.\nThe use of private email has become a major issue in recent months for White House hopeful Hillary Clinton, since it emerged that she had operated a private account while secretary of state.\nMr Brennan became director of the CIA in 2013, having spent four years as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism.",

    "source": "In a series of Twitter posts addressed directly to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro also called him a \"petty dictator\".\nMr Maduro accused the OAS chief earlier this week of being a CIA agent and a traitor himself.\nThe Venezuelan president has blamed his country's economic crisis on an axis of enemy forces co-ordinated from the US.\nDuring a three-hour long news conference on Tuesday, Mr Maduro had justified his declaration of a state of emergency by saying Venezuela was under attack from imperialist forces led by the CIA.\nHe then told journalists: \"Almagro, just give up. He has been a traitor for a long time... At some point I will tell his story, I know his secrets. The Americans, the CIA, have played a master move using Almagro as their agent.\"\nMr Almagro, who before leading the OAS was the foreign minister of his native Uruguay, had already clashed with Mr Maduro last year after he called him \"rubbish\".\nMr Almagro had responded on that occasion with an eight-page open letter, saying he would be \"rubbish\" if he ignored the plight of the Venezuelan people.\nHis Twitter posts this week were both more concise and more direct.\nLinking to his open letter to Mr Maduro, Mr Almagro said: @NicolasMaduro I'm not a traitor either to my ideas or my principles BUT YOU ARE A TRAITOR to your people.\nIn a series of 12 tweets, he also told the Venezuelan president that \"you will NEVER be able to undo so much suffering, intimidation, misery and anguish you've created for your people\".\nHe also said Mr Maduro would \"NEVER be able to bring back to life the children who've died because of lack of medicine\".\nVenezuelan doctors say a shortage of essential medicine has reached a crisis point.\nMr Almagro also urged Mr Maduro to allow a recall referendum to go ahead.\nOpposition politicians have handed in a petition with 1.85 million signatures to the electoral authorities requesting a referendum be held to recall Mr Maduro from office.\nBut Mr Maduro's deputy, Vice-President Aristobulo Isturiz, on Sunday ruled out such a referendum, saying the signatures were \"fraudulent\".\nMr Almagro said that not letting the referendum go ahead made Mr Maduro \"another petty dictator\".\nWhile President Maduro did not answer Mr Almagro's tweets directly, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez did.\nShe wrote, \"Mr Almagro, every time you make a statement you express your hatred against Venezuela and its legitimate authorities. You are part of the imperialist detritus.\"\n\"You only repeat the scripted words which your imperialist masters dictate to you\".\n\"You will never give orders to Venezuela!\"\nThe former president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, has also commented on the row between Mr Almagro, who served as Mr Mujica's foreign minister, and President Maduro.\nAsked what he made of the bitter exchange, he said using a popular Spanish saying that Mr Maduro was \"crazy as a goat\".\n\"They're all crazy in Venezuela, they call each other all sorts of things but they're not going to fix anything this way.\"\nWhile Mr Mujica is known for his direct and outspoken manner his words are damaging to Mr Maduro, who has always praised the former left-wing president as a \"comrade\".",

He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\"\nAfter \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again.\nThis time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets.\nYet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\".\nHe adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\"\nMr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle.\nAt the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand.\nDespite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand.\nSo he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado.\nReturning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later.\nQuick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps.\nHe says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for \u00a31 and they would retail them for \u00a32. For us the net profit was 35%.\"\nSupermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices.\nThen one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price.\nAn incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down.\nWith sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting \u00a314m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business.\nMr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment.\n\"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\"\nUnhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost \u00a340m.\nLooking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka.\nSo with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born.\nAimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for \u00a335 a bottle.\nWhile Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales.\nAnd showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made.\nAlso now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week.\nMr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand.
